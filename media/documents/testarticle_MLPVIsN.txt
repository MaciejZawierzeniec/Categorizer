INFINITELY MANY REAL FORMS
TIEN-CUONG DINH, KEIJI OGUISO, AND XUN YU
Abstract. Using a special complex K3 surface and its blow up, we construct a smooth
complex projective rational surface with infinitely many mutually non-isomorphic real
forms. This gives a negative answer to a long standing open question if a smooth complex
projective rational surface has only finitely many non-isomorphic real forms or not.
1. Introduction
We work over C. Let VR → Spec R be an R-scheme. The associated C-scheme
V = VR ×Spec R Spec C
is said to be defined over R. We call UR → Spec R a real form of V if UR ×Spec R Spec C is
isomorphic to V over Spec C. Two real forms UR → Spec R and U
′
R → Spec R of V are said
to be isomorphic if they are isomorphic over Spec R. (See [Se02, Chapter 5] for details.)
In this paper, we denote the set of real points VR(R) simply by V (R) when VR is fixed.
There is a long standing open question since Kharlamov [Kh02]:
Question 1.1. Is there a smooth complex projective rational surface with infinitely many
real forms ? We always mean up to isomorphisms.
The first breakthrough for Question 1.1 is made by Lesieutre [Le18]. He shows that there
is a smooth complex projective variety of dimension 6 with infinitely many real forms. His
6-fold is not rationally-connected so that not rational, either. The result has been expanded
by [DO19] and [DOY21], which show that there is a smooth complex projective surface
with Kodaira dimension 0 with infinitely many real forms and for each integer n ≥ 3
there is a smooth complex projective rational variety of dimension n with infinitely many
real forms. More recently, Bot [Bo21a] and [Bo21b] found very remarkable results closely
related to Question 1.1 for smooth complex rational affine surfaces. However, the original
question for a smooth complex projective rational surface remains unsolved by now, and
Question 1.1 and closely related questions are re-asked and studied by several authors, see
e.g. [Be16], [Be17], [Le18], [DO19], [DFMJ20], [Ki20], [DOY21], [Bo21a] and [Bo21b].
The aim of this paper is to give a first negative answer to Question 1.1 as in Theorem
1.2 below. To state our result precisely, we prepare a few notations. Let

Then the smooth complex projective rational surface P := P
1 × P
1
is defined over R as
P = PR ×Spec R Spec C.
Let λ ∈ R be a real number and T → P be the blow up of 16 real points (a, b) of P(R),
where
a ∈ {0, 1, 2, ∞} , b ∈ {0, 1, λ, ∞}.
Let C11,T ≃ P
1 be the exceptional curve on T over (∞, ∞). Let QT ∈ C11,T (R) = P
1
(R)
be a real point and let
X := XQT → T
be the blow up of T at QT . Then the surface X is a smooth complex projective rational
surface defined over R. Note that the surface X depends on the two parameters λ ∈ R
and QT ∈ C11,T (R).
Our main theorem is now stated as follows:
Theorem 1.2. If both λ ∈ R and QT ∈ C11,T (R) are generic, then the smooth complex
projective rational surface X = XQT
has infinitely many mutually non-isomorphic real
forms.
The precise definition of the genericity of λ ∈ R is given in Section 2 and the precise
definition of the genericity of QT ∈ C11,T (R) is given in Section 3.
We use results in [Le18] and [DO19] in our proof. Especially, we prove Theorem 1.2 by
using a special K3 surface studied in [Og89] and [DO19].
It is known that V has only finitely many real forms and the automorphism group
Aut(V ) is finitely generated if V is a K3 surface ([DIK00], [St85], see also [CF20]). In
[DO19], we found, as the first example, that some smooth projective surface birational to
a K3 surface has infinitely many real forms and its automorphism group is non-finitely
generated. The surface in [DO19] is constructed as the blow up of a K3 surface at least
four points including infinitesimally near points. Mukai then asked us: ”Is it possible to
make a smooth complex projective surface with non-finitely generated automorphisms group
and/or with infinitely many real forms, as one point blow up of a K3 surface ?”
As a byproduct of our argument used in the proof of Theorem 1.2, we also show the
following result.
Theorem 1.3. There exist a smooth K3 surface S and a point Q ∈ S such that the blow
up S
′ of S at Q satisfies the following two statements:
(1) Aut(S
′
) is discrete and not finitely generated; and
(2) S
′ admits infinitely many real forms which are mutually nonisomorphic over R.
Theorem 1.3 gives a positive answer for the question of Mukai above and gives simplest
known surfaces satisfying the two above statements. See Section 4 for a more precise
construction of S
′
.
In Section 2, we fix notations concerning a Kummer surface Km (E×F) and review some
properties of the surface from [DO19], which we will use throughout this paper. Some of
the results in Section 2 are also new. We then prove Theorem 1.2 in Section 3 and Theorem
1.3 in Section 4 respectively.

2. Preliminaries
In this section, we fix notations concerning automorphisms, some Kummer surface
Km (E × F) and also recall some properties of the surface. Though we will use the same
notations in [DO19], we recall all notations we will use later for the convenience of the
reader. We also recall some properties which we will use. We refer the reader to the corresponding statements of [DO19] for details, while some statements presented here are new,
for which we will also give a full proof.
For a variety V and a family of subsets Wi ⊂ V (i ∈ I), we define the subgroups
Aut(V, Wi (i ∈ I)), Ine(Y, Wi (i ∈ I)) of Aut(V ) by
Aut(V, Wi (i ∈ I)) := {f ∈ Aut(V )| f(Wi) = Wi (∀i ∈ I)}.
Ine(V, Wi (i ∈ I)) := {g ∈ Aut(V, Wi(i ∈ I))| g|Wi = idWi
(∀i ∈ I)}.
We denote the fixed point set of f ∈ Aut(V ) by
V
f
:= {x ∈ V | f(x) = x}.
Let E and F be the elliptic curves defined over R respectively by the Weierstrass forms
y
2 = x(x − 1)(x − 2) , (y
′
)
2 = x
′
(x
′ − 1)(x
′ − λ),
where λ is a generic real number in the sense that E and F are not isogenous. For instance
transcendental real number λ is such a number. Let
S := Km (E × F)
be the Kummer K3 surface associated to the abelian surface E × F. The surface S is also
defined over R under the natural real structure induced from the real structures of E and
F above.
Let {ai}
4
i=1 and {bi}
4
i=1 be the 2-torsion groups of F and E respectively. Then S contains
24 smooth rational curves as in Figure 1; 8 smooth rational curves Ei
, Fi
, with 1 ≤ i ≤ 4,
arising from 8 elliptic curves E × {ai}, {bi} × F on E × F, and 16 exceptional curves
Cij , with 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 4, over the 16 singular points of type A1 on the quotient surface
E ×F/h−1E×F i. See also Figure 1 for the configuration of these 24 smooth rational curves
on S. Note that these 24 smooth rational curves are also defined over R under the natural
real structure of S. In what follows, we use the notation in Figure 1.
Throughout this paper, we use x for the affine coordinate of E1 = E/h−1Ei and x
′
for
the affine coordinate of F1 = F/h−1F i and set (with respect to the coordinates x and x
′
):
C := E1 , P := C ∩ C11 = ∞ , C ∩ C21 = 0 , C ∩ C31 = 1 , C ∩ C41 = 2.
P1 := F1 ∩ C11 = ∞ , F1 ∩ C12 = 0 , F1 ∩ C13 = 1 , F1 ∩ C14 = λ.
Let θ ∈ Aut(S) be the involution induced by the involution (1E, −1F ) ∈ Aut(E × F).
Then θ
∗ωS = −ωS. Here and hereafter ωS stands for a non-zero global holomorphic 2-form
on S, which is unique up to scalar multiplications by C \ {0}.
We consider the quotient surface and the associated quotient morphism
T := S/hθi , π : S → T.
By definition of θ, we find that T is the blow-up of P
1 × P
1 at the 16 points (a, b) (a ∈
{∞, 0, 1, 2}, b ∈ {∞, 0, 1, λ}) under the identification P
1 × P
1 = C × F1. In particular, T
is a smooth complex projective rational surface defined over R. Note also that the surface

T with natural real structure here coincides with the surface T with real structure defined
in Introduction.
Lemma 2.1. We have the following:
(1) S
θ = ∪
4
i=1(Ei ∪ Fi) and f ◦ θ = θ ◦ f for all f ∈ Aut (S). In particular, Aut(S) =
Aut(S, ∪
4
i=1(Ei ∪ Fi)). Moreover, θ(R) = R for any smooth rational curve R on S.
(2) Aut(S, P) = Aut(S, C, P).
(3) Aut(T) = Aut(S)/hθi.
Proof. The assertion (1) is proved by [DO19, Lemma 3.3] or by [Og89, Lemmas (1.3)
and (1.4)]. The assertion (2) is proved by [DO19, Lemma 3.4] as an immediate but very
important consequence of (1). Indeed, since C = E1 is the unique irreducible component
of ∪
4
i=1(Ei ∪ Fi) containing the point P, we find that f(C) = C if f ∈ Aut(S, P).
We show the assertion (3). By (1), we have a natural inclusion Aut(S)/hθi ⊂ Aut(T).
By the construction of T, the quotient morphism π is nothing but the finite double cover
branched along the divisor D := P4
i=1(π(Ei) + π(Fi)). Note that D is a disjoint union of
8 smooth rational curves of self-intersection −4 and D ∈ | − 2KT |. We claim that
| − 2KT | = {D}.
This is proved as follows. Observe that D is a sum of disjoint irreducible curves with
negative self-intersection number. If dim |D| ≥ 1, then |D| has a fixed component, as
(D2
)T < 0. Let R be an irreducible component of the fixed component of |D|. Then R
is one of π(Ei) or π(Fi), and D − R is an effective divisor which is again a disjoint union
of irreducible curves of negative self-intersection and satisfies dim |D − R| = dim |D| ≥ 1.
Then, applying the same argument as above, we deduce that |D−R| has a fixed component,
say R′
, such that D − R − R′
is an effective divisor which is again a disjoint union of
irreducible curves of negative self-intersection and satisfies dim |D−R−R′
| = dim |D−R| ≥
1. Repeating this, we finally reach the case where dim |Z| ≥ 1 for the divisor Z = 0, a
contradiction. Thus, dim |D| = 0 and the claim follows.

Let f ∈ Aut(T). Then, since f preserves the class of −2KT in Pic (T) ≃ NS (T), we
have
f ∈ Aut
T,X

i=1
(π(Ei) + π(Fi))
by the claim above. Hence f lifts to an automorphism of S. This completes the proof.
From now, we denote π(W) simply by WT . For instance π(C11) = C11,T , which is
consistent with the notation in Introduction.
Next, we recall one more important involution ι of S and its conjugates from [DO19]. As
in [DO19, Page 956], consider the elliptic fibrations ΦDi
: S → P
1
(i = 1, 2) on S defined
respectively by the complete linear systems |Di
| of the divisors of Kodaira’s singular fiber
type,
D1 := C + C11 + F1 + C12 + E2 + C22 + F2 + C21
and
D2 := C + 2C11 + E2 + 2C12 + E3 + 2C13 + 3F1.
We choose C31 as the zero section of both ΦD1 and ΦD2
.
Denote by ι the inversion of the elliptic fibration ΦD2
(with respect to the zero section
C31). Then ι ∈ Aut(S) and ι is an involution of S such that ι
∗ωS = −ωS. Denote by f1
the translation automorphism of the elliptic fibration ΦD1 given by the section C41 (with
respect to the zero section C31). Then f1 ∈ Aut(S) and f
∗
1ωS = ωS. We finally define
ιn := f
−n
1
◦ ι ◦ f
n
1
(∀n ∈ Z).
Lemma 2.2. The automorphisms ι, f1 and ιn satisfy the following properties:
(1) The fixed locus S
ι
is a disjoint union of three smooth rational curves C11, C31, C34
and a smooth curve of genus 4, with self-intersection number 6.
(2) ι acts as a nontrivial involution on each of the smooth rational curves C, F1, F3, E4.
(3) All ι, f1 and ιn preserve C and C11. Moreover, we have
ι|C(x) = 2 − x , f1|C(x) = 2x , ιn|C(x) = 1
2
n−1
− x.
Proof. (1) This assertion is proved by [DO19, Lemmas 4.2 and 4.3].
(2) Recall that ι is the inversion of the elliptic fibration ΦD2 with respect to the zero
section C31 and D2 is a fiber of this fibration. It follows that D2 is invariant by ι. Since
F1 is the only component with coefficient 3 in D2, it is invariant by ι. The components
C and F1 contain fixed points which are their intersections with C11, see (1). These two
components are invariant as well.
Recall that the divisor
D
′
2
:= F3 + 2C34 + F2 + 2C24 + F4 + 2C44 + 3E4
is also a fiber of ΦD2
, see e.g. [DO19, Page 958]. Arguing as above, we obtain that E4 is
invariant by ι. Finally, by (1), the restriction of ι to each of the curves C, F1, F3, E4 is a
nontrivial involution.
(3) We have seen that ι preserves C and C11. The invariance of C by f1, as well as
the second formula in (3), are proved in [DO19, Page 957]. It follows that the point of
intersection between the two components C and C11 of D1 is fixed by f1. As a fiber of ϕD1

RATIONAL SURFACES WITH INFINITELY MANY REAL FORMS 6
D1 is invariant by f1. Thus, C11 is also invariant by f1. By the definition of ιn, we easily
deduce that C and C11 are invariant by ιn.
Finally, in the affine coordinate x of C, ι|C is a nontrivial involution which fixes the
points C ∩ C11 = ∞ and C ∩ C31 = 1. Thus, ι|C(x) = 2 − x as claimed in the first formula
in (3). The last formula follows from the first two formulas.
We denote by Σ0 the unique smooth curve of genus 4 in S
ι given in Lemma 2.2(1).
Let us consider the inertia group
Ine(S, C11) = {g ∈ Aut(S, C11)| g|C11 = idC11 }
and its two subgroups
Ine±
(S, C11) := {g ∈ Ine(S, C11)| g
∗
(ωS) = ±ωS},
Ines
(S, C11) := {g ∈ Ine(S, C11)| g
∗
(ωS) = ωS}.
As before, ωS is a non-zero global holomorphic 2-form on S.
The next lemma will be also used in Sections 3 and 4.
Lemma 2.3. We have the following statements:
(1) Let f ∈ Ine(S, C11). Then f ∈ Aut(S, C, P) and we have a representation
τ : Ine(S, C11) → Aut(C, P) ; f 7→ f|C.
The image τ (Ines
(S, C11)) of Ines
(S, C11) is an abelian group.
(2) ιn ∈ Ine±
(S, C11) and the number of conjugacy classes of {ιn | n ∈ Z} in Ine±
(S, C11)
is infinite.
Proof. (1) Since P ∈ C11, we have f(P) = P for f ∈ Ine(S, C11), that is, f ∈ Aut(S, P)
if f ∈ Ine(S, C11). Since Aut(S, P) = Aut(S, C, P) by Lemma 2.1(2), it follows that
f ∈ Aut(S, C, P) and we have the representation τ .
We show that τ (Ines
(S, C11)) is an abelian group. Let f ∈ Ines
(S, C11). Since f
∗ωS = ωS
with f(P) = P, we have det df|TS,P = 1 for the differential map df|TS,P : TS,P → TS,P . Since
df|TS,P preserves the transversal lines TC11,P and TC,P in TS,P , as f preserves both C and
C11. Moreover, df|TS,P is identity on TC11,P as f ∈ Ine(S, C11). Thus, df|TS,P is also identity
on TC,P as det df|TS,P = 1. Hence, f|C is of the form f|C(x) = x + a (a ∈ C). Therefore,
τ (Ines
(S, C11)) is a subgroup of the additive group (C, +). In particular, τ (Ines
(S, C11)) is
an abelian group. This proves (1).
(2) By Lemma 2.2(1)(3) and the definition of ιn, we have ιn ∈ Ine(S, C11) for all integers
n. On the other hand, by the definitions of ι and f1, we have ι
∗ωS = −ωS and f
∗
1ωS = ωS.
It follows that ι
∗
nωS = −ωS. Therefore, ιn ∈ Ine±
(S, C11) for all integers n.
Now, let S1 be the blow up of S at P and S2 the blow up of S1 at a finite ι|P(TS,P )-stable
subset Q of the exceptional curve P(TS,P ) ⊂ S1. For the same argument as in (1), we
deduce that f ∈ Ine±
(S, C11) acts on P(TS,P ) and the action is identity if f
∗ωS = ωS,
while the action coincides with ι|P(TS,P )
if f
∗ωS = −ωS. So, Ine±
(S, C11) naturally lifts to a
subgroup of Aut(S2). By [DO19, Lemma 4.5], for a suitable choice of Q, in any subgroup
of Aut(S2) which contains the ιn, the number of different conjugacy classes of ιn is infinite.
The assertion (2) follows easily.
We close this section by the following general lemma, which will be also used in the next
two sections.

Lemma 2.4. Let V be a smooth complex projective surface. Let D be an irreducible curve
in V such that (D2
)V < 0. Then there exists a countable subset A ⊂ D such that the
following statement holds: if Q ∈ D \ A, g ∈ Aut(V ) and g(Q) ∈ D, then g ∈ Aut(V, D);
in particular, for any Q ∈ D \ A, we have Aut(V, Q) = Aut(V, D, Q).
Moreover, this holds for any smooth rational curve D on any complex projective K3
surface V .
Proof. Let
A := 
R | R ⊂ V an irreducible curve , R 6= D and (R
2
)V < 0
	
,
and let
A := ∪R∈A(D ∩ R).
Note that the N´eron-Severi group NS(V ) is countable. Moreover, for any element α ∈
NS(V ) with (α
2
)V < 0, there exists at most one irreducible curve R such that [R] = α.
Thus, A is a countable set. Then A is also countable. Let Q ∈ D \ A. Let g ∈ Aut(V )
with g(Q) ∈ D. Then g
±1
(D) is an irreducible curve and (g
±1
(D)
2
)V = (D2
)V < 0.
To complete the proof, it suffices to show g(D) = D. Suppose otherwise g(D) 6= D.
Note that g(Q) ∈ D ∩g(D) and Q ∈ g
−1
(D)∩D. Since g
−1
(D) ∈ A, it follows that Q ∈ A,
a contradiction. This proves the first statement. The second one is obvious and the last
one is also clear because (D2
)V = −2 for a smooth rational curve D on a K3 surface V .
3. Proof of Theorem 1.2
In this section, we prove Theorem 1.2. We use the same notation as in Section 2. For
instance, S = Km (E × F), P ∈ C ⊂ S, Cij ⊂ S are the same as in Section 2, θ, ι and ιn
are the involutions of S, and π : S → T is the quotient morphism by θ and so on.
From now, we often denote the object on T induced from an object W on S by WT . For
instance the curve π(C11) on T is denoted by C11,T and the automorphism of T induced
by f ∈ Aut(S) under the isomorphism in Lemma 2.1(3) by fT .
Recall that by Lemma 2.3(2), ιn ∈ Ine±(S, C11) as an automorphism of S.
Lemma 3.1. Let m ≥ 3 and let Q1, . . . , Qm be m distinct points in C11. Then the involutions ιn define infinitely many conjugacy classes in Aut(S, C11, {Q1, . . . , Qm}).
Proof. Since C11 ∼= P
1 and m ≥ 3, it follows that
[Aut(S, C11, {Q1, .., Qm}) : Ine(S, C11)] < ∞.
Thus, it suffices to show that the involutions ιn define infinitely many conjugacy classes
in a subgroup of Ine(S, C11) of finite index. However, Ine±
(S, C11) is such a subgroup
by Lemma 2.3(2). Note that Ine±
(S, C11) is a finite index subgroup of Ine(S, C11) as the
canonical representation of Aut(S) has a finite image (see e.g. [Ue75, Theorem 14.10]).
We now apply Lemma 2.4 for the pair (V, D) = (S, C11). As in the proof of that lemma,
define
A := 
R | R ⊂ V an irreducible curve , R 6= C11 and (R
2
)S < 0
	
,
and consider the countable set
A := ∪R∈A(C11 ∩ R).
RATIONAL SURFACES WITH INFINITELY MANY REAL FORMS 8
Recall that C11 is defined over R and C11(R) is an uncountable set. We say that a point
Q ∈ C11(R) is generic if Q 6∈ A ∪ {P, P1}.
Lemma 3.2. Let Q ∈ C11(R) be a generic point. Then
Aut(S, {Q, θ(Q)}) = Aut(S, C11, {Q, θ(Q)}) = Aut(S, C11, {P, P1, Q, θ(Q)})
and the involution θ belongs to this group.
Proof. Observe that A = θ(A) by Lemma 2.1(1). It follows that θ(Q) is also a generic
point, i.e. outside A ∪ {P, P1}. The first identity is a consequence of Lemma 2.4. The
second one is a consequence of Lemma 2.1(1) because the union of 8 curves there intersects
C11 exactly at P and P1. The assertion on θ is also clear because {Q, θ(Q)} is invariant by
θ. Note that the lemma still holds if we replace {Q, θ(Q)} by any non-empty set of generic
points which is invariant by θ.
From now until the end of this section, we assume that Q ∈ C11(R) as in the last lemma.
Let SQ → S be the blow up at Q and θ(Q). Then θ lifts to an automorphism of SQ and
we have the quotient morphism
π
′
: SQ → X := XQT
:= SQ/hθi.
Then X is the same surface in Theorem 1.2 except that the choice QT = π(Q) ∈ T is not
yet specified. We have natural morphisms
X → T → P = P
1 × P
1
,
where T → P is the blow up at 16 points (a, b) as in Section 2 and X → T is the blow up
of T at QT := π(Q). Observe the following lemma.
Lemma 3.3. The surface X satisfies the following statements:
(1)
NS (X) ≃ Pic X = Z[H1] ⊕ Z[H2] ⊕ ⊕i,jZ[Cij,X] ⊕ Z[EQT
],
where letting Hi (i = 1, 2) be the two general rulings of P, which are defined over
R, we denote the pullback of Hi on X by the same letter Hi
, the curve Cij,X is
the proper transform of the curve Cij,T = π(Cij ) on X and EQT
is the exceptional
divisor of the blow up X → T at QT = π(Q).
(2) The natural representation
ρ : Aut(X) → Aut(NS (X)) = Aut(Pic (X))
is injective.
Proof. The first assertion is clear from the morphism X → T → P. Let us show the second
assertion. Let g ∈ Ker (ρ). Then g([EQT
]) = [EQT
], g([Cij,T ]) = [Cij,T ] in Pic (X). Note
that |EQT
| = {EQT
} and |Cij,X| = {Cij,X}, as the curves are irreducible of negative selfintersection numbers. Therefore, g(EQT
) = EQT
, g(Cij,X) = Cij,X as divisors on X. Thus,
g descends to the automorphism gP ∈ Aut(P
1×P
1
) under the blow-down X → P = P
1×P
1
so that the 16 points (ai
, bj ) are pointwisely fixed by gP. Recall that
Aut(P
1 × P
1
) = (PGL (2, C) × PGL (2, C)) · hsi,
where s(x, y) := (y, x) for (x, y) ∈ P
1 ×P
1
. Then by gP(a, b) = (a, b) for all 16 points (a, b),
it follows that gP = idP. Hence g = idX as well.

Note that the involutions ιn ∈ Aut(S) descend to the involutions ιn,T ∈ Aut(T) by
Lemma 2.1(3). Then by the choice of Q and by Lemma 2.3(2), ιn,T ∈ Ine(T, C11,T ). Thus,
the involutions ιn,T lift to the involutions on X, which we will denote by ιn,X.
The actual main theorem of this paper is the following, from which Theorem 1.2 stated
in Introduction is deduced. We use here the notion of genericity introduced just before
Lemma 3.2.
Theorem 3.4. For every generic point Q ∈ C11(R), the conjugacy classes of {ιn,X} in the
group Aut(X) is infinite.
Proof of Theorem 3.4 implies Theorem 1.2. We closely follow an argument of [Le18]. Let
c = (idXR
, c) be the complex conjugation of
X = XR ×Spec R Spec C → Spec C
with respect to the natural real structure XR of X in the construction. As the divisors
in the formula in Lemma 3.3(1) are all defined over R with respect to the natural real
structure of X, it follows that c
∗
is trivial on Pic (X). Thus, we have (c ◦ f ◦ c)
∗ = f
∗ on
Pic (X). Since c◦f ◦c ∈ Aut(X), it follows from Lemma 3.3(2) that c◦f ◦c = f, that is, f
is defined over R and the conjugate action of the Galois group Gal(C/R) = hci on Aut(X)
is trivial as well. Thus, by [Le18, Lemma 13] and by the fact that the conjugacy classes
of {ιn,X} under Aut(X) is infinite by Theorem 3.4, we conclude that X admits infinitely
many mutually non-isomorphic real forms.
Proof of Theorem 3.4. Since the involutions ι and θ commute, ι◦θ is a nontrivial involution
of the K3 surface S preserving ωS. Thus, S
ι◦θ
consists of exactly eight points by the
fundamental result due to Nikulin [Ni80], see also [Mu88, (0.1)]. On the other hand,
according to Lemma 2.2(2), ι acts as a nontrivial involution on the four disjoint smooth
rational curves C, F1, F3, E4. Then each of the eight distinct points C
ι ∪ F
ι
1 ∪ F
ι
3 ∪ Eι

is
fixed by both θ and ι. From these observations, we conclude that
C

ι

3 ∪ E

4 = S
ι ∩ S
θ = S
ι◦θ = {x ∈ S| ι(x) = θ(x)}.
Thus, by Lemma 2.2(1), the fixed locus T
ιn,T of ιn,T ∈ Aut(T) is equal to the disjoint union
of the four smooth irreducible curves
C11,T = π(f

(Σ0)),
whose self-intersection numbers are −1, −1, −1, 3 because the self-intersection numbers
of C11, C31, C34, Σ0 are −2, −2, −2, 6 respectively.
Since Σ0 is a nef and big divisor on S, so is π(f
−n

(Σ0)) on T. It follows that there are
only finitely many irreducible curves Dn1, . . . , Dnk for some positive integer k ≥ 3 such
that (Dni.π(f

(Σ0)))T = 0 for i = 1, . . . , k. We may and will assume that Dn1 = C11,T ,
Dn2 = π(f

(C31)), Dn3 = π(f

(C34)). Observe that all these curves have negative selfintersection numbers. Therefore, except for i = 1, they belong to the family A defined
above. This, together with Lemma 3.2, imply
(Q1) Aut(S, {Q, θ(Q)}) = Aut(S, C11, {Q, θ(Q)}) = Aut(S, C11, {P, P1, Q, θ(Q)});
(Q2) QT := π(Q) ∈/ Dni ∩ C11,T for any n and any i ≥ 2.
Recall that X = XQT
as the blow up of T at the point QT ∈ C11,T (R). Let EQT ⊂ X
be the exceptional curve over QT . We may and will identify Aut(T, QT ) as a subgroup
RATIONAL SURFACES WITH INFINITELY MANY REAL FORMS 10
of Aut(X) in a natural manner. Suppose g ∈ Aut(X) and g
−1 ◦ ιn,X ◦ g = ιm,X for some
m, n ≥ 0. We first show that g ∈ Aut(T, QT ).
Since ιn,T is a nontrivial involution and C11,T is contained in its fixed locus, ιn,X acts as
a nontrivial involution on EQT
. Therefore, it fixes exactly two points of EQT
, say Pn1 and
Pn2. We may assume that Pn1 = C11,X ∩ EQT
. Here, C11,X is the proper transform of C11,T
in X. Then the fixed point locus of ιn,X ∈ Aut(X) (resp. ιm,X ∈ Aut(X)) is the disjoint
union of the point Pn2 (resp. Pm2) with four smooth irreducible curves, of self-intersection
numbers −2, −1, −1, 3, which are the proper transforms of the fixed locus of ιn,T (resp.
ιm,T ). Since g
−1 ◦ ιn,X ◦ g = ιm,X , we have
g(X
ιm,X ) = X
ιn,X .
It follows that
g(C11,X) = C11,X, g(π(f

(Σ0))X ) = π(f
−n

(Σ0))X, g(Pm2) = Pn2,
where we add the superscript X to denote the proper transform of a curve to X. Note
that the irreducible curves in X which do not intersect π(f

are exactly EQT

, . . . , DX

g(EQT ∪ D
X
m1 ∪ . . . ∪ D
X
mk) = EQT ∪ D
X
n1 ∪ . . . ∪ D

nk.
Then by Property (Q2) above, we have that EQT doesn’t intersect DX
mi and DX
ni. Using
that g(Pm2) = Pn2, we obtain g(EQT
) = EQT
. Therefore, g ∈ Aut(T, QT ).
Using Property (Q1) and Lemma 2.1(3), we have
Aut(T, QT ) = Aut(S, {Q, θ(Q)})/hθi = Aut(S, C11, {P, P1, Q, θ(Q)})/hθi.
Then by Lemma 3.1, the conjugacy classes of {ιn,X } in the group Aut(T, QT ) is infinite.
Since ιn,X cannot be conjugated to ιm,X by elements in Aut(X) \ Aut(T, QT ) as observed
above, the conjugacy classes of {ιn,X} in the group Aut(X) is infinite too. This completes
the proof.
4. Proof of Theorem 1.3
We continue to use the same notations as in Section 2. For instance, λ ∈ R is generic
and
P = C ∩ C11 ∈ C , C11 ⊂ S = Km (E × F), f1, ι ∈ Aut(S)
are the same as in Section 2 and all defined over R with respect to the natural real structure
of the elliptic curves E and F.
In this section, we prove the following theorem, from which Theorem 1.3 clearly follows.
Theorem 4.1. There exists a point Q ∈ C11(R) such that the blow up S
′ of S at Q satisfies
the following two statements:
(1) Aut(S
′
) is discrete and not finitely generated; and
(2) S
′ admits infinitely many real forms which are mutually nonisomorphic over R.
Proof. Note that C11(R) is an uncountable set. By Lemma 2.4, there exists a point Q ∈
C11(R) \ (C ∪ F1) such that
Aut(S, Q) = Aut(S, C11, Q).
Let S
′ be the blow up of S at Q and EQ ⊂ S
′ be the exceptional divisor. Then
Aut(S, C11, Q) = Aut(S, Q) = Aut(S
′
).

Note that |KS′| = {EQ} by the canonical bundle formula. The last equality follows from
this.
Recall the affine coordinate x of C in Section 2 and the actions of f1, ι on C described
as in Lemma 2.2. In particular, we have
ι|C(x) = 2 − x , ιn|C(x) = (f

Let f3 := ι ◦ ι1. Then f3 ∈ Aut(S, C) and we obtain
f
∗
3 ωS′ = ωS′ and f3|C(x) = x + 1,
where ωS′ is the the pull-back of the symplectic form ωS to S
′
. By Lemma 2.3, we have
the representation
τ : Ines
(S, C11) −→ Aut(C, P)
and the image τ (Ines
(S, C11)) is an abelian group. On the other hand, since f

(S, C11) and
f

◦ f3 ◦ f

|C(x) = x +

,
it follows that the abelian group τ (Ines
(S, C11)) contains a non-finitely generated abelian
group as a subgroup, see e.g. [DO19, Proposition 2.5(2)]. Thus, Ines
(S, C11) is not finitely
generated. Consider the sequence of finite index subgroups (see the end of the proof of
Lemma 3.1 for the first inclusion)
Ines
(S, C11) ⊂ Ine(S, C11) ⊂ Aut(S, C11, {P, P1, Q}) = Aut(S, C11, Q) = Aut(S, Q),
and the equality
Aut(S, Q) = Aut(S
′
)
under the natural identification made above (using the fact that S is a smooth K3 surface).
Therefore, Aut(S
′
) is not finitely generated, as it has a finite index subgroup Ines
(S, C11)
which is not finitely generated, see e.g. [DO19, Proposition 2.5(1)]. Hence (1) is proved.
Since Q ∈ C11(R) ⊂ S(R), it follows that S
′
is defined over R. Consider the group
Ine±
(S, C11) := {g ∈ Ine(S, C11)| g
∗
(ωS) = ±ωS}
defined in Section 2. By Lemma 2.3, ιn ∈ Ine±
(S, C11) and Ine±
(S, C11) is a finite index subgroup of Aut(S, C11, {P, P1, Q}) = Aut(S
′
) (under the natural identification made
above). By Lemma 3.1, ιn define infinitely many conjugacy classes in Ine±
(S, C11). Then by
[Le18, Lemma 13], S
′ admits infinitely many real forms which are mutually nonisomorphic
over R.
