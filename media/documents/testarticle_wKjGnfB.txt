Much like birds fly in flocks and fish swim in swarms, cells
in our body move in groups. Collective cell migration enables
embryonic development, wound healing and cancer cell invasion. These phenomena involve complex biochemical regulation, but their dynamics can ultimately be predicted by emerging physical principles of living matter.
When and where do cells migrate in groups?
When seen at the microscale, our body is a busy maze filled
with actively moving cells. Cellular movements are slow,
rarely exceeding 10 µm/min, but crucial to embryonic development, the immune response, tissue self-renewal and wound
healing. Through the same mechanisms that sustain these
physiological functions, cell movements drive devastating diseases such as acute inflammation and cancer. These can in
fact be considered diseases of cell movement because arresting cells in a controlled manner would be sufficient to prevent
their spread. Take cancer as an example; whereas its origin
is well-known to be genetic, if we could selectively stop the
movement of tumor cells, we would prevent them from escaping primary tumors and reach distant organs to metastasize.
Understanding cell migration is therefore crucial to improve
current strategies to fight disease.
Cell migration comes in different flavors. Some cell types
move as isolated self-propelled particles. For example, to
chase and destroy pathogens, immune cells move individually
through tissue pores. Similarly, in some types of cancer, single
cells dissociate from tumors and travel solo through the surrounding tissue, eventually reaching blood vessels and metastasizing at distant organs. By contrast, in other physiological
functions and pathological conditions, cells move as collectives. Collective cell movements are dominant in embryo development, where they enable the precise positioning of tissues and organ progenitors. The later coordination of growth
and motion shapes organs well into postnatal life. Collective
cell migration also drives wound healing in tissues such as the
skin. Here, a continuous sheet of tightly adhered cells moves
cohesively over the damaged area to restore a functional tissue. Cancer invasion also involves the migration of cell sheets,
strands and clusters (Fig. 1a). Within these groups, cells with
different function can self-organize in spatial compartments
to behave like an aberrant organ. This added functionality
is thought to provide malignant tumors with distinct invasive
strategies that improve their chances of spreading and metastasizing. Finally, collective cell migration is also involved in
maintaining the inner surface of the gut, which is the fastest
self-renewing tissue in mammals. It renews entirely every 3-
5 days, which implies a daily loss of tens of grams of cells.
Self-renewal proceeds thanks to the division of stem cells that
reside at the bottom of tissue invaginations called crypts. The
progeny of these stem cells then migrates collectively from the
crypt to the top of finger-like protrusions called villi, where
they are shed into the intestinal lumen and discarded (Fig. 1b).
Collective cell migration is regulated by a myriad of molecular processes, from genetic programs to sensing and signaling pathways. Yet, these molecular processes act upon a limited number of physical quantities to determine cell movement. Therefore, coarse-grained physical approaches may
provide crucial insight into biological questions. Furthermore,
collective cell behaviors also inspire new physical theories of
living systems. In this article, we highlight progress in this
direction.
Cell assemblies as living matter
What physical principles underlie collective cell motion? In
traditional condensed matter, interactions between electrons
and between atomic nuclei give rise to fascinating collective
phenomena such as magnetism and superconductivity. Analogously, cell-cell interactions lead to emergent collective phenomena in migrating cell groups. However, when treating cell
colonies as materials, we must take into account some key features of living matter, as we illustrate throughout the article.
First, the primary constituents of living tissues are cells and
extracellular networks of protein fibers such as collagen. The
interactions between these mesoscale constituents are orders
of magnitude weaker than interatomic interactions in conventional solids. So, with notable exceptions like bone, most biological tissues are soft materials, which can easily deform and
flow.
Second, cells are machines with internal engines. Specialized proteins known as molecular motors harness the energy
of chemical reactions to generate forces and produce mechanical work. These energy-transducing molecular processes ultimately power cell migration, allowing cells to move autonomously, without externally applied forces. This continuous supply of energy drives living tissues out of thermodynamic equilibrium. Importantly, the driving is local; it occurs
at the level of individual constituents, i.e. single cells. In

other words, cells are active constituents, and living tissues
are a paradigmatic example of active matter — an exploding
new field in nonequilibrium statistical physics.
But cells are not only mechanically active: they also sense
their environment, process information, and respond by adapting their behavior. For example, stem cells plated on substrates of different stiffness differentiate into distinct cell
types, from brain to bone cells. So living tissues are adaptive: they respond in programmed ways to environmental cues
such as external forces, the mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix, and concentrations of nutrients and signaling
molecules. Consequently, cell-cell and cell-environment interactions are often very complex. Unlike atoms and electrons
in conventional condensed matter, cellular interactions cannot
in general be fully described via an interaction potential with a
fixed functional form. Thus, a key challenge in this field is to
find effective ways to capture complex cell behaviors in terms
of simple, physically-motivated interactions1
.
To flow or not to flow
One way to think about interactions between deformable
epithelial cells comes from the physics of foams. In foams,
gas bubbles arrange in polygonal packings, with the liquid
phase filling the interstitial spaces and providing surface tension to bubble interfaces (Fig. 2a). Similarly, cells in epithelial monolayers also acquire polygonal shapes, with roughly
straight edges subject to active tension generated inside cells
(Fig. 2b). This description of tissues as polygonal cell packings traces back to work by Hisao Honda and collaborators
in 1980, and it was later popularized by work in the group
of Frank Julicher and collaborators ¨

. Because cells are deformable, edge lengths vary dynamically. These variations
change the energy of the cellular network, which we can write
in terms of areas Ai and perimeters Pi of cells i = 1, . . . , N

This energy assumes that cells resist changes in their area and
perimeter around the preferred values A0 and P0 with elastic
moduli κ and Γ, respectively. The preferred perimeter P0 depends on cell-cell interactions and cellular activity, with cellcell adhesion promoting longer edges and cellular tension favoring shorter edges. The preferred perimeter and area define a dimensionless parameter p0 = P0/
√
A0 which informs
about the preferred cell shape. Higher p0 corresponds to more
elongated cells, and smaller p0 corresponds to more isotropic
shapes, with less perimeter for the same area.
For a given p0, edge lengths vary until the system reaches
its ground state, minimizing the energy in Eq. (1). In this process, an edge can shrink until it eventually disappears, leading
to the formation of a new cell-cell interface (Fig. 2c). These
events, known as T1 transitions, allow cells to change neighbors, driving topological rearrangements of the cellular network. The ability to reorganize its constituents determines
whether a material is solid or fluid. So, if cell rearrangements
are difficult, the cellular network resists shear deformations;
the tissue is solid. In contrast, if cells can rearrange easily, the
network yields upon shear; the tissue is fluid. At small p0, i.e.
for roundish cells, Eq. (1) reveals that there is an energy barrier preventing T1 rearrangements (Fig. 2c). However, as we
increase p0 and cells become more elongated, the energy barrier decreases (Fig. 2c). At a critical value of p0 = p
∗
0 ≈ 3.81,
the barrier vanishes (Fig. 2d); cells can rearrange freely2
.
This simple model thus predicts a solid-fluid transition

a shear component5
. The normal component indicates the extent to
which a material is tensed or compressed at a given point, whereas the
shear component indicates forces parallel to the surface.
Besides the ability to generate active stresses, a key feature that
differentiates tissues from passive soft materials is the self-propulsive ability of each individual cell. Cells achieve self-propulsion by
extending distinct types of protrusion and adhering them to their
surroundings. The two main types of protrusion are thin actin-rich
extensions called filopodia or lamellipodia, and spherical membrane
blisters called blebs. Cells migrate using lamellipodia, filopodia or
blebs, depending on a diversity of intrinsic and extrinsic variables,
including expression of adhesion proteins, density and composition
of the ECM, confinement, topology and cortical contractility60,61. To
migrate, cells adhere their protrusions to the surrounding matrix
either specifically through membrane receptors such as integrins,
or unspecifically using frictional interactions.
Box 2 | Mechanobiology as a multiscale problem
One the great challenges of mechanobiology is the existence of
multiple length scales at which relevant mechanisms are at play.
!is problem has led to the development of diverse types of modelling approach describing biological tissues at di"erent scales.
Examples of mechanical models of cells and tissues include the
following.
1. Clutch models describe the dynamics of cell–matrix adhesion at the molecular level (a,e in #gure below). !ey take into
account the rigidity of the matrix, the binding/unbinding (kon,
ko") rates of adhesion proteins and the force that myosin motors
exert on these proteins through the actin cytoskeleton. Clutch
models have been successful at predicting traction forces and
dynamics of the leading edge of a protruding cell, sensing of
rigidity and matrix ligand spacing, and durotaxis4,56,57.
2. Polymer network models are based on the polymeric nature
of the cytoskeleton (b,f in #gure below). !ey take into account the properties of single #laments, their spacing (df
 in
panel f below), the deformability and binding rates of polymer crosslinking proteins (kon, ko" in panel f), and the activity
of molecular motors that pull on the #laments (F in panel f).
!ese models capture fundamental rheological properties
of cells such as strain-sti"ening, scale-free elastic modulus,
$uidization and ageing130,131.
3. Vertex models treat cell monolayers as 2D or 3D polygonal
objects that share common vertices (see also Box 3) (c,g
in #gure below). In three dimensions, these models are
governed by tissue geometry and by surface tensions of
the apico-basal (γab) and lateral surfaces (γl
). Vertex models
have predicted dynamic aspects of monolayers, such as their
ability to deform through intercalation, to jam at constant
density and to $ock as solids and liquids82,83,86,87,132.
4. Continuum models describe tissues as active materials in
which the cellular structure is coarse-grained (d,f in #gure
below). !ese models are formulated in terms of continuum
vectorial and tensorial #elds such as velocity, v, polarity p
and stress σ. !ese variables are linked through viscosity
η, elasticity k and friction ζ. In three dimensions, they also
incorporate luminal pressure ∆P. Continuum models have
successfully described complex features of cell monolayers
such as wave propagation in the absence of inertia76,133.

two regimes: a static regime with results identical to those presented

with most observations of biological tissues. Geometrically,

In non-biological materials, bulk quantities such as shear/bulk
modulus, shear viscosity and yield stress are often used to describe
the mechanical response to external perturbations. However,
cells are self-propelled and, even in the absence of external
forces, cells in confluent tissues regularly intercalate, or exchange
neighbours26,27. In an isotropic confluent tissue monolayer where
mitosis (cell division) or apoptosis (cell death) are rare, cell
neighbour exchange must happen through intercalation processes
known as T1 transitions28,29, where an edge between two cells shrinks
to a point and a new edge arises between two neighbouring cells,
as illustrated in Fig. 1a. The mechanical response of the tissue is
governed by the rate of cell rearrangements, and, within the vertex
model, the rate of T1 rearrangements is related to the amount of
mechanical energy required to execute a T1 transition29. Therefore,
we first study how these energy barriers change with single-cell
properties encoded in the model parameters r and p0.
To explore the statistics of energy barriers, we test all possible
T1 transition paths (see Methods) in ten randomly generated
disordered samples each consisting of M = 64 cells. For each
value of p0 and r tested, we obtained the distribution of energy
barrier heights ⇢(1"). The functional form of the distribution
becomes universal (Fig. 1a) when scaled by the mean energy
barrier height 1"(r,p0). The rescaled distribution is fitted well by a
k-gamma distribution (kk
xk1 exp(kx)/(k1)!)with x =1"/1"
and k=2.2±0.2. The k-gamma distribution has been observed
in many non-biological disordered systems30–32, and generically
results from maximizing the entropy subject to constraints31,32. This
confirms that the distribution of energy barriers depends on the
single-cell properties p0 and r only through its average 1".
Figure 1b shows the dependence of 1" on p0 for various values
of r.At p0 .3.8, the energy barriers are always finite—that is, cells
must put in some amount of work to deform and rearrange. Here
the tissue behaves like a solid; it is a rigid material with a finite
yield stress. As p0 is increased, the energy barriers decrease and
become vanishingly small in the vicinity of p0 ⇡ 3.8, so that cell
rearrangements cost almost no energy. This suggests that the vertex
model may undergo a critical rigidity transition near p0 ⇡3.8.
To test this hypothesis, we searched for a scaling collapse
based on theories for continuous phase transitions near a critical
point, such as the Ising model for ferromagnetism. Figure 1b
demonstrates that r sets the overall scale of 1" as well as the
‘sharpness’ of the transition, whereas p0 controls the distance to the
transition. This suggests that the trio (r1",r, p0 p⇤
0 ) is analogous
to (m, h, T Tc) in the Ising model. Therefore, our scaling ansatz
is that the order parameter r1"(r, p0) vanishes at the critical
point p0 = p⇤
0 , with fluctuations controlled by r. In that case, near
the critical point the order parameter should obey the universal
scaling form33:

 is the crossover scaling variable,  is the

the crossover scaling functions for p0 <p⇤

After re-plotting the data in Fig. 1b using equation (3),
we find an excellent scaling collapse onto two branches with

0 ? As in other
rigidity transitions6,35,36,40, we expect that the critical shape index
should also be related to isostaticity. In the vertex model with
periodic boundary conditions, cells tile the flat two-dimensional
plane, and therefore the total number of vertices V, cells M
and edges E are related through Euler’s formula: 0=V E +M.
As each edge is shared by two cells, E is also related to the
average coordination number z of cells or E =Mz/2, which yields
V =M(z/21). The degrees of freedom are simply the motions of
each vertex in two dimensions: ndof =2V. Assuming force balance
(in both directions) and torque balance on each cell generates three
constraints per cell: nc =3M. At isostaticity, the number of degrees
of freedom equals the number of constraints: ndof = nc, resulting
in ziso =5 and suggesting a mean-field transition at a shape index
of p⇤
0 ' 3.812. Although it gives a correct prediction, this isostatic
argument makes a strong assumption: that constraints are applied to
each cell instead of to each vertex. Therefore, an interesting direction
for future research is to understand under what circumstances the
energy functional (equation (2)) eectively groups vertices into
functional units that are cells.
Discussion
Although the vertex model has been used extensively to model
tissues over the past 15 years, there has never been a clear way to
connect the model parameters to tissue mechanical properties. Here
we show that the vertex model has a new and previously unreported
critical rigidity transition that occurs at a critical value of the target
shape index p⇤
0 ⇠3.81. This criticality is evident in energy barriers
to local T1 rearrangements, the vibrational spectrum of the linear
response, and the shear modulus of the tissue. Unlike SPP models,

model has a constant-density glass transition governed by singlecell mechanical properties such as cell–cell adhesion and cortical
tension encoded in the target shape index p0.
Analysing only the ground states of the vertex model, the
seminal work of Staple et al.16 found an ordered-to-disordered
transition at p0 =phex
0 ⇠3.722. However, because almost all biological
tissues are strongly disordered, it remained unclear whether this
transition was relevant for the observed glass or jamming transitions
in multicellular tissues. Therefore, we explicitly study disordered
metastable states and transitions between them. In addition ref. 16
uses a linear stability analysis of a single cell to suggest that a
rigidity transition also occurs at phex
0 . In contrast, our analysis
explicitly includes multicellular interactions (that is, collective
normal modes) and nonlinear eects (that is, energy barriers).
With this more sophisticated analysis, we demonstrate that vertex
models exhibit a rigidity transition at a value p0 =p
pent
0 ⇠3.81 that is
measurably dierent from the prediction p0 =phex
0 based on singlecell linear stability.
Importantly, predictions based on this critical rigidity transition
have recently been verified in experiments43. Specifically, in both
simulations and experiments we can measure the shape index
p=P/
pA for each cell in a monolayer, where P is the projected
cell perimeter and A is the cross-sectional area. In simulations of
the vertex model, we find that the median value of the observed
shape index p is an order parameter that also exhibits critical scaling:
p=p⇤
0 ⇠3.81 for rigid or jammed tissues and p becomes increasingly
larger than p⇤
0 as a tissue becomes increasingly unjammed (Fig. 2).
This prediction is precisely realized in cultures from primary cells
in human patients, with implications for asthma pathobiology43.
We expect that this rigidity framework will help experimentalists develop other testable hypotheses about how the mechanical
response of tissues depends on single-cell properties. For example, Sadati et al.44 have proposed a jamming phase diagram where
tissues become more solid-like as adhesion increases, based on
observations of jamming in adhesive particulate matter at densities
far below confluency. Using standard interpretations of the vertex
model (equations (1) and (2)), p0 increases with increasing adhesion,
and therefore our model predicts that confluent tissues become
more liquid-like as adhesion increases. This highlights the fact that
adhesion acts dierently in particulate and confluent materials; in
particulate matter higher adhesion leads to gelation and solidification, whereas in the vertex model larger adhesion leads to larger
perimeters, more degrees of freedom, and liquid-like behaviour.
These ideas suggest that the role of adhesion in tissue rheology may
be much richer and more interesting than previously thought.

(Fig. 2e). This is a striking prediction, which showcases the
bizarre mechanical properties of materials with deformable
constituents. In conventional condensed matter, solids melt by
either increasing temperature or reducing the packing fraction,
i.e. decreasing pressure. Tissues, however, can melt at a fixed
temperature and at the maximum packing fraction, φ = 1, i.e.
without gaps between cells2
. Tissues can become fluid by increasing the cell perimeter-to-area ratio, for example by either
decreasing intracellular tension or, counterintuitively, increasing cell-cell adhesion (Fig. 2e). The more cells adhere to one
another, the more they elongate, and the easier it is for them
to rearrange.
Shortly after its prediction2
, this solid-fluid transition
driven by changes in cell shape was experimentally verified
in layers of human bronchial epithelial cells4
. Moreover, this
study showed that cells from healthy individuals tended to be
caged by their neighbors and form a solid tissue, whereas cells
from asthmatic individuals tended to remain unjammed, forming a fluid tissue. Therefore, these experiments suggested that
the fluid-solid transition in tissues is involved in disease, opening the door to new treatments based on preventing this phase
transition. Fluid-solid transitions also occur during development, enabling tissues to first turn fluid in order to remodel
and acquire their shapes, and then solidify and mature. The
emerging picture is that, in different biological contexts, cells
can tune their shape and use the physical principles governing
phase transitions in foams to decide whether to flow or not to
flow.
Aligning with neighbors
The action starts once tissues become fluid and cells can
move. Cells then engage in collective flows of different types,
depending on how cells align with neighbors to coordinate
their individual motions. Again, these cell-cell interactions
depend strongly on cell shape.
Cells come in many different shapes: some are roughly
spherical, some have rod-like shapes, and some cells develop
a head-tail asymmetry to migrate persistently in one direction. This direction can be represented by a vector known as
cell polarity. In groups, cells can align their individual polarities, forming phases of matter with orientational order. These
alignment interactions and the resulting oriented phases can
be described using concepts from the physics of magnetism
and liquid crystals. For example, cells in a group can spontaneously break symmetry and align in a common direction.
This type of alignment is known as polar order. To capture its
emergence, one can introduce ferromagnetic-like interactions
between individual cell polarities. At a coarse-grained level,
collective cell polarity can be thought to result from an effective free energy with the Mexican-hat shape familiar from the
Landau theory of phase transitions. This example thus illustrates how tools and concepts from other fields of physics are
being borrowed to rationalize cell alignment.
In other situations, cells align along one axis but choose
no preferred direction of motion. This type of alignment is
known as nematic order, taking its name from nematic liquid crystals, used in LCD screens. Prominent features of liquid crystals are singular points known as topological defects,
where alignment is locally lost. You can find topological defects literally on your own hands: they are the points where
your fingerprint ridges meet (Figs. 3a and 3b). Recently, researchers have discovered topological defects in several cell
assemblies, from bacterial colonies to epithelial tissues, confirming that they can be described as liquid crystals (Fig. 3c).
Interestingly, topological defects can play important biological roles. For example, in epithelial monolayers, defects pro-

according to the cell cycle phase, which is known as the interkinetic
nuclear migration11. To see whether the direction switching is related
to cell cycle, we used the cell-cycle marker Fucci12, and found that the
switching of direction occurs within the same G1 or G2 cell cycle phase
(Supplementary Video 6). This is in contrast to the interkinetic motion
seen in vivo, where the motion of the nucleus is directed to the basal
end (G1) or the apical end (G2) of the NPC, depending on its cell cycle
phase11, although there was a difference in the timescale of switching
between the two phases (Extended Data Fig. 4a–c)
13.
Active nematic systems are predicted to have spatio-temporal correlations between densities and strengths of nematic order that are
 distinct from those of equilibrium systems3–5. By picking out areas
that do not contain defects14, we confirmed giant number fluctuation
and quasi-long-range order (Extended Data Fig. 5a and b) in the highdensity NPC culture. In the same regions, we calculated the spatial
correlations of cell density and alignment fluctuations (Extended
Data Figs 6 and 7a–f) and found that the fluctuations of density and
alignment were correlated (see Supplementary Information). The
correlations were positive in the first and third quadrant when seen
as a function of two-dimensional displacements, indicating that the
system is an extensile active nematic system3,5,15. This feature of the
correlation was flipped and weaker in the case of a cultured myoblast
cell line C2C12, which also shows a nematic pattern (Extended Data
Fig. 8a and b). We further found that the spatial correlation of the cell
density was anisotropic when the typical length scale of correlation
in the direction parallel to the alignment was larger than that in the
direction perpendicular to it (Extended Data Fig. 6).
A clear signature of ‘activeness’ in a macroscopic system can be found
at the topological defects. It has been observed both in experiment
and simulation16–25 that + 1/2 defects typically undergo spontaneous
motion in active nematic systems, which is in contrast to defects in
equilibrium liquid crystals26. Topological defects in the biological
 context have been observed in whorled grain in wood17 as well as
in tube formation in embryonic development. Examples of defects
yielding non-equilibrium collective dynamics include in vitro21,22,27
and in vivo28 cytoskeleton dynamics, bacterium flows in liquid crystal
mixtures23,25, colony growth dynamics24, and the cAMP patterning of
aggregating social amoeba29.
As has been reported in other works on cell cultures9,30,31, we clearly
observed +1/2 and −1/2 defects in the dense NPC culture (Fig. 4a).
We found slow motions of defects (3.7µ m h−1
 on average) including
the merging of defects with opposite winding numbers (Fig. 4b). In
Fig. 4c, we show the local nematic order around the topological defects
calculated from the displacement of cells inside small regions. Figure 4d
shows the net velocity field calculated from the same data, indicating
that there is a flow of cells pointing in the direction of the front of the
comet shape in + 1/2 defects (Fig. 4c), whereas no clear directionality
exists in the − 1/2 defects. The direction of the defect motion in the
NPCs was opposite to that for passive liquid crystals, C2C12 (Fig. 4e),
and the confluent fibroblasts reported in ref. 31.

(Figs. 2a and 3a,b,g) and the average shear flow vanished although the
cells remained very motile and the convergent flow was not affected
(Fig. 3c–f,h,i). The shear velocity fluctuated in space and time about
a zero mean (Fig. 3e,i).
In summary, for L>Lc, the cell population organizes in a
nematic phase with a director at a finite angle with the main
direction of the stripe. In parallel, cells spontaneously develop
complex flows with shear and transverse components. Below the
threshold Lc, cells orient in the direction of the stripe and no net
shear flow develops.
To understand these observations, we modelled our system as
a confined active nematic fluid27,28. Indeed, despite the obvious
practical differences, our confined cells share the same fundamental symmetries as a contractile acto-myosin network powered by
ATP hydrolysis between parallel plates29. We therefore developed
an adapted version of the physical model of ref. 29 that predicts that
active nematics confined in a stripe of width L exhibit a generic continuous transition at a critical width Lc between an ordered immobile state and a flowing state. This transition is analogous to the
Fréedericksz transition of nematic liquid crystals30 but it is driven
by the intrinsic activity of the system rather than an external field.
To account for the finite angle of the edge cells (Fig. 2b), we adapted
the model by assuming a finite anchoring at the walls. The torque
exerted on the cells by the edges is then balanced by the nematic
elastic torque (see Supplementary Note).
For widths larger than but close to the critical width (L ≳ Lc), the
angle θ is predicted to vary across the stripe as θ ~ +ε

very good agreement between these theoretical scaling predictions

(Fig. 4a,b). Similar results were obtained for C2C12 mouse myoblasts. In this case, we measured λ =12 ±2 µ m and Lc

The theory thus captures the main features of the biological system
and in particular the existence of the transition that we now identify as a Fréedericksz transition driven by cell activity. Spontaneous
flow transitions are typical of active matter; other examples include
low-Reynolds-number turbulence or spontaneous topological singularities in translation and rotation27,31. Here, we demonstrate their

Flowing on their own
Describing orientational order is not enough to account for
collective cell flows. To this end, physicists describe cell assemblies as active matter1,8
. For example, when cells align
with polar order, they can start migrating in the direction of
alignment9
. This type of collective motion is known as flocking. The active-matter theory of this phenomenon was developed 25 years ago inspired by the mesmerizing flights of
bird flocks10. Today, the principles of flocking are applied to
many other systems, from synthetic active colloids to bacterial
swarms.
To describe nematic cell colonies, researchers use the theory of active liquid crystals, which generalizes the hydrodynamics of liquid crystals to include active (cell-generated)
stresses. Among many other phenomena, this theory explains
the cell flows observed around topological defects. Again,
beyond cell colonies, the theory successfully describes many
other systems, from biopolymer gels to shaken granular materials. Employing general theories of active matter to describe
cell migration is particularly useful because it reveals connections to apparently-unrelated systems. Progressively, this approach is uncovering a classification of active systems based
on symmetries and generic behaviors, in the spirit of universality classes in statistical mechanics.
For example, the theory of active liquid crystals was originally inspired by behaviors in bacterial suspensions and in
the cell cytoskeleton. Soon after formulating the theory, researchers predicted that active stresses generate an instability
whereby these fluids start flowing spontaneously, without having to apply external forces14. To drive flows, active stresses
have to overcome alignment forces in the liquid crystal, which
happens only at sufficiently large scales. Therefore, the theory
predicted that a strip of active fluid would flow only if it was
wide enough14
.
More than a decade later, these predictions were tested in
cell monolayers5
, showcasing the generic character of the theory. Whereas cells confined in narrow stripes did not flow,
cells in stripes wider than a critical width developed a collective shear flow as predicted by the theory (Fig. 3d). In
very large tissues, cell flows become chaotic, creating disordered patterns of swirls known as active turbulence15. Confinement can therefore prevent and organize spontaneous cell
flows. This regulatory role of confinement may be relevant
in embryonic development and tumor invasion, in which cell
groups often migrate in tracks defined by the surrounding tissue (Fig. 1a). Overall, these studies showcase how cells can
leverage the physics of active fluids to engage in collective
flow patterns, and how confinement controls whether and how
cell groups flow on their own.
To spread or not to spread
What happens if we release confinement and expose a cell
monolayer to free space? Cells at the monolayer edge are

Figure 1 | Experimental model. a, A PDMS membrane is deposited on a
collagen-coated polyacrylamide (PA) gel. Cells are seeded and allowed to
attach only over the gap defined by the PDMS membrane. When confluent
cells reach a relatively high confluence, the PDMS membrane is peeled off
and cells start invading the surrounding space. b, Transversal view of

circles) and cell sheet area due to proliferation (white circles) at different
time points. The area due to proliferation was calculated by counting the
number of cells in the monolayer at distinct time points and then
multiplying the number of new cells by the average cell area. Data are
mean ± s.d. (n = 5). Inset: relative contribution of cell proliferation to cell
sheet area.
With time, these boundary layers became markedly heterogeneous
but systematically grew to encompass increasing numbers of
cells; cell–cell tension transmission exhibited a growing scale
of length (Fig. 2k), and the maximum intercellular shear stress
(µ¯ ) followed a similar pattern (Fig. 2m,n). Taken together, these
findings demonstrate that force transmission from cell-to-cell,
and cellular migration across the epithelial sheet, are initiated at
the leading edge and progressively penetrate towards the centre
(Supplementary Movie S3).
Moreover, these stress fields were anisotropic. At each position
in the monolayer plane, the maximum (max) and minimum
(min) principal stresses5 were represented as an ellipse aligned
with corresponding principal orientations (Fig. 2p). Throughout
epithelial expansion, stress ellipses tended to be spindle-shaped
and thus revealed pronounced stress anisotropy. The maximum
principal stress orientation tended to be perpendicular to the
leading edge and thus roughly parallel to local cell motion
(Fig. 2q). As described previously, this mode of local cell guidance
defines plithotaxis2,5.
Superposed on systematic monolayer spreading were largescale spatio-temporal fluctuations of tractions, monolayer stresses
and cellular velocities (Fig. 2f,i,l,o). To better characterize the
systematic evolution of mechanical patterns, we averaged these
variables over the observable monolayer length (corresponding
to the y coordinate), thereby reducing the dimensionality of the
system to only one spatial dimension and one temporal dimension.
All data could then be represented as kymographs in the x–t
plane (Methods). Kymographs of cellular velocity (vx ) revealed
motility patterns that were not restricted to the initial phase of
inward mobilization (Fig. 3a). To the contrary, after reaching the
monolayer midline at ⇠150 min, the two fronts of cell motility
coalesced and then continued towards the leading edges. When
cells are cohesive and mass is conserved, cellular velocities must
be linked to the rate of cell deformation (strain rate, "˙xx ; ref. 11)
through the expression "˙xx = @vx/@x. Remarkably, kymographs of
"˙xx revealed clear evidence of wave-like crests of strain rate that were
launched at each leading edge, propagated away from and back to
the leading edge at roughly twice the speed of the advancing front
edge, and spanned the entire monolayer (Fig. 3b). To distinguish
these mechanical waves from other known types of mechanical
wave, and because they inscribe an X-shape on the kymograph,
we call them X-waves.
To study the physical origin of the X-wave, we next focused
on traction generation and stress transmission in the monolayer.
Whereas traction kymographs demonstrated extrema at the leading
edge, monolayer stresses were highest at the monolayer midline,
indicating that local force generation was globally integrated and
transmitted through cell–cell junctions to give rise to a stress
build-up (Fig. 3c,d). Importantly, monolayer stress at the midline
oscillated in time (Fig. 3g,h and Supplementary Movie S4); these
oscillations were in phase with fluctuations of cell area (Fig. 3f,h)
and demonstrated phase quadrature with strain rate (Fig. 3e).
Contrary to long-held assumptions (reviewed in ref. 12), these
observations establish that on the ultraslow timescales of cellular
migration the dominant cellular stresses in the monolayer are
elastic, not viscous.
In the absence of appreciable inertia, there can exist no exchange
between kinetic and potential energy storage as is usually associated
with propagation of passive mechanical waves, thus suggesting
that the mechanism underlying the observed propagation might
be active. To investigate this possibility, we inhibited myosin using
blebbistatin. Blebbistatin prevented the formation of stress fibres
(Supplementary Fig. S2) and had little effect on the velocity of the
leading edge, thus confirming previous reports in wound scratch
assays8. Blebbistatin caused traction forces and intercellular stresses
to be abrogated, however (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Movie S5).
A well-defined front of strain rate could be clearly identified
nonetheless, but this front was stationary, did not propagate

even originate far away from the edge and be
brought to the front by flows within the epithelium
(51). Indeed, cells far away from the edge of a
monolayer have been shown to extend cryptic lamellipodia underneath their neighbors (21), suggesting that leader cells are not necessarily
restricted to the edge of a monolayer (FIGURE 3B).
These leader cells drag along a small cluster of
follower cells, resulting in the formation of “fingerlike” instabilities of the leading front (51). Staining
reveals thick actin bundles (51) as well as stretched
E-cadherin morphology (48) connecting the leaders to the followers, suggesting a strong mechanical coupling and force transmission within these
finger-like structures. Velocity field analysis and
mechanical perturbation of leader cells using laser
ablation strongly support the role of leader cells in
providing local guidance cues to cells following
them (53). It was further observed that inhibition

to a viscoelastic model, the aggregate’s elastic
modulus, viscosity, and surface tension are determined. This technique has the advantage of a
relatively simple experimental setup and image
analysis. Using this technique on aggregates of
mouse sarcoma cell lines expressing E-cadherin,
Guevorkian et al. reported that the aggregate’s
surface tension increased with the applied pressure
(21), which could indicate an active reinforcement of the aggregate in response to the applied
stress. Such a reinforcement has not been reported
in parallel-plate compression experiments. Although
in parallel-plate compression aggregates are compressed to a constant strain, with the exerted stresses
being relaxed over a typical time scale of about
an hour, in micropipette aspiration aggregates
undergo a continuous traction at constant stress.
It has been reported that traction forces elicit
active cell contractile responses (37, 38), which
may not arise during compression. A systematic
study comparing parallel-plate compression and
micropipette aspiration on aggregates of the same
cell lines would help to clarify the effect of these
differences. It has also been pointed out that whereas in parallel-plate compression the whole aggregate is stressed, micropipette aspiration probes
only a subset of the aggregate’s cells (39). The
number of cells subjected to stress scales as Rp
3
.
Thus, for the continuum hypothesis to be valid
and the technique applicable to characterize aggregate rheology, the micropipette radius should
be large enough to probe a few hundreds of cells,
which is usually accomplished with Rp ≈ 30 mm.
The existence of a yield modulus above which
aggregates exhibit plastic behavior remains a matter of controversy. Some authors have postulated
the existence of a yield modulus in tissues, which
physically would arise from the critical force
required to break intercellular bonds and induce
cellular reorganization (22). To our knowledge,
no systematic experimental investigation of the
existence of a yield stress in tissues has been conducted. Existing experimental observations such
as the spontaneous fusion of two aggregates
(40) seem to suggest that the yield stress, if it
exists, is smaller than the stresses induced by
tissue surface tension, and thus deformations are
relaxed by surface tension over a time scale of
the order of hR/g, where R is the characteristic
aggregate size (typically a few hundred micrometers). Moreover, bond formation and dissociation is more accurately described as a dynamic
process, where the formation and dissociation
rates vary continuously with the applied load. An
appealing solution to the debate about the existence of tissue plasticity has been suggested by
Marmottant et al. (41), who proposed that the

stood, edge cells respond to this asymmetric environment by
polarizing toward free space (Fig. 4a). Specifically, these cells
extend protrusions known as lamellipodia, with which they
exert directed and persistent traction forces on the underlying substrate to migrate toward open ground. Because cells
in the monolayer are adhered to one another, the migrating
edge cells pull on cells in the second row, which then also
polarize, migrate, and pull on inner cells, setting the monolayer under tension16 (Fig. 4b). At the molecular level, this
supracellular coordination is mediated by a protein known as
merlin, which transduces intercellular forces into cell polarization. In this mechanically-coordinated way, the entire cell
monolayer spreads on the substrate, becoming progressively
thinner11 (Fig. 4a). Combined with other mechanisms, this
type of collective cell migration helps to close gaps in epithelial tissues, as in wound healing.
But tissues not always spread on substrates. Under certain conditions, a cell monolayer may instead retract from
the substrate, eventually collapsing into a droplet-like cell
aggregate13 (Fig. 4c). Tissue spreading and retraction are
therefore reminiscent of the wetting and dewetting of liquid
droplets. The degree of wetting depends on the balance between cohesive forces within the liquid and adhesive forces
with the substrate. By analogy, early models proposed that
tissue wetting was dictated by a competition between cell-cell
(Wcc) and cell-substrate (Wcs) adhesion energies12,17, encoded
in a spreading parameter S = Wcs − Wcc. When S < 0, cellcell adhesion dominates and the cell aggregate retracts from
the substrate (dewetting, Fig. 4c left), whereas when S > 0,
cell-substrate adhesion dominates and the aggregate spreads
(wetting, Fig. 4c right). This simple conceptual framework
was sufficient to interpret the behavior of cell aggregates of
varying cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion12,17. However,
this analogy to passive liquids does not explicitly account for
the active nature of cells.
Recent work addressed this limitation by treating the cell
monolayer as a droplet of active liquid13. Using this approach,
one obtains the spreading parameter directly in terms of active
cellular forces. Supported by experiments, the model predicts
that the wetting transition results from the competition between two types of active forces: cell-substrate traction forces
that promote spreading versus cell-cell pulling forces that promote retraction. This active wetting framework makes another key prediction: the spreading parameter depends on the
droplet radius. Cell monolayers larger than a critical radius
wet the substrate, whereas smaller monolayers dewet from it
(Fig. 4d). This prediction is striking because it has no counterpart in the classic wetting picture, in which the spreading
parameter depends solely on surface tensions. For regular liquid droplets, size does not matter. In contrast, tissue wetting is
size-dependent. This prediction was verified in experiments,
providing evidence for the active nature of tissue wetting13
.
Besides its relevance in physics, the existence of a critical
size for tissue wetting might explain drastic changes in tissue
morphology during embryonic development and cancer progression. For example, a disturbing possibility is that a growing tumor might become able to spread onto the surrounding
tissue once it reaches a critical size. Overall, this work exemplifies how the quest to understand collective cell migration
motivates the development of new physics, leading to the discovery of phenomena like active wetting. Finally, this physics
approach offers clues on how cell aggregates may tune active
forces to control whether to spread or not to spread.
Mechanical waves without inertia
Tissue spreading revealed yet another striking collective
phenomenon: Mechanical waves start spontaneously at the
leading edge and propagate across the cell monolayer11
(Fig. 5). These waves are slow, with speeds ∼ 10 − 100
µm/h, and wavelengths that span several cell diameters. Simi-
6
et al., 2019). Earlier studies have shown that ERK activation
propagates as multiple waves from leader cells to the follower
cells during collective cell migration using in vitro cultured cells
(Handly et al., 2015; Matsubayashi et al., 2004; Nikolic et al.,
!
2006) and in vivo mouse ear skin (Hiratsuka et al., 2015).
Recently, we have demonstrated that the ERK activation waves
orient the directed migration of a cell cluster against the wave
direction, indicating a critical role of the ERK activation waves
in coordinated cell migration (Aoki et al., 2017). However, it remains largely unknown how cells harness the mechanotransduction and the ERK activation waves to coordinate collective
cell migration.
In this study, by combining Fo¨ rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensors (Harvey et al., 2008; Komatsu
et al., 2011), an optogenetic tool (Aoki et al., 2013), traction
force microscopy (Trepat et al., 2009), and mathematical
modeling, we show that each follower cell possesses a mechanochemical feedback system, in which stretch-induced ERK
activation triggers cell contraction. Intercellular coupling of
the ERK-mediated mechanochemical feedback enables sustained propagation of ERK activation and contractile force
generation, leading to multicellular alignment of front-rear cell
polarity over long distances. Thus, our study clarifies a mechanism of intercellular communication underlying long-range
sustained transmission of directional cues for collective cell
migration.
RESULTS
Cell Deformation Waves Precede ERK Activation Waves
To investigate the relationship between ERK activation and cell
deformation during collective cell migration, Madin-Darby canine
kidney (MDCK) cells confluently seeded within compartments of
a silicone confinement were released for collective cell migration.
ERK activity and cell deformation were evaluated by FRET imaging with EKAREV-NLS, by which ERK activation is quantified as
an increase in the FRET/CFP ratio (Komatsu et al., 2011), and particle image velocimetry (PIV)-based image processing, respectively. As the cells migrated toward free spaces, sustained ERK
activation waves were propagated from the leader cells to the follower cells (Figures 1A and 1B; Video S1), in agreement with previous reports (Aoki et al., 2017; Matsubayashi et al., 2004). The
cell deformation, i.e., extension and shrinkage, was quantified
by the cell strain rate in the direction of collective cell migration
(x-strain rate). Similar to the ERK activity, the x-strain rate exhibited repeated positive and negative values, namely extension
and shrinkage, which propagated from the leader cells to the follower cells (Figures 1A and 1C; Video S1), as described previously (Serra-Picamal et al., 2012; Tlili et al., 2018). Hereinafter,
we refer to the propagation of the x-strain rate as cell deformation
waves (Rodrı´guez-Franco et al., 2017).
To analyze the correlation between the ERK activation and the
cell deformation, time series data of the ERK activity and those of

Results
Firstly, in agreement with previous studies of expanding MDCK
monolayers25,27,34, we confirmed that directional waves of cellular density and ERK activity propagate away from leading edges
towards the centre of colonies (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). Moreover,
we performed the same experiments at full two-dimensional (2D)
confluency (Fig. 1a–d and Supplementary Video 1) and found similar patterns of ERK and cell density (with ERK positively correlated
with, and slightly lagging behind, 2D cell area), although in this
case they displayed random orientation of propagation. This suggests that monolayer expansion (mediated by leading edges) is not
required for wave formation, motivating us to first study theoretically how isotropic waves of ERK and density arise in the confluent
setting.
For this, we first wrote down a minimal model of epithelial
monolayer mechanics that we highlight here (see Supplementary
Section I for details). The 3D shape of MDCK cells, like in other epithelial tissues, is proposed to arise from a balance of forces between
the active stresses generated by actomyosin cortices at the apical,
lateral and basal surfaces35–37 (resp. denoted as γa, γl
 and γb). For a
single cell on a flat surface, equilibrium of these forces requires that
the in-plane length of a cell l is equal to a ratio of active tensions,
such that l / γl
γaþγb
! "1=3
I
. However, for confluent, heterogeneous
epithelial tissues, cell–cell junctions impose mechanical couplings
between cells38, so that the mechanical state of each cell influences
the shape, density and velocity of its neighbours39. To describe this
we consider, in a simple 1D setting, a linear chain of coupled cells
with vertex positions ri
 and surface tensions γi
 (Fig. 1e). If a given
cell contracts, it imposes a stress on its neighbours, which is resisted
by cellular tensions, as well as by frictional forces with the substrate
fi = −ζvi
 (where ζ is a cell–substrate friction coefficient dependent on cell–substrate adhesion and vi = ∂t
ri
 the velocity of the cell
vertex ri
).
At the continuum limit and at linear order, force balance in such
a monolayer reads
τr∂trðx; tÞ¼ ∂xxrðx; tÞ$ ∂xl0ðx; tÞ ð1Þ
with all units normalized by the average cell length, and r the
vertex position at distance x and time t. The first two terms are
classical for overdamped chains of oscillators, and represent resp.
frictional forces and restoring forces from active cell tensions (with
τr
= ζ/k, the ratio of cell–substrate friction to cell stiffness, giving
a timescale for the spatiotemporal diffusion of displacement r,
on length scales of cell size). The third term arises from the fact
that each cell at position x can in principle have its own preferred
length l0, so that gradients of preferred length result in cellular

and lateral tensions γa,b,l. The dependence of ERK activation on cell length l completes a mechanochemical feedback loop between ERK activation, cortical
tensions and cell aspect ratio. f, Linear stability of this model (equation (4)) reveals a finite wavelength oscillation (Re(ω) > 0, dashed line) above a certain
strength αβcrit of mechanochemical coupling. g, This instability is confirmed in numerical simulations of the model (kymograph).

Figure 5 Waves during tissue spreading. (a) Space-time plots
(known as kymographs) of the activity of the signalling molecule
ERK (left) and of the strain rate (right) during tissue spreading.
Waves, indicated by white arrows, appear as oblique lines, whose
slope gives the wave speed. From N. Hino et al. Dev. Cell 53, 646
(2020). (b) Schematic of the feedback between ERK activity, cell
tension, and cell length, which produces mechanochemical waves.
(c) Schematic showing that cells polarize and migrate against the
mechanochemical wave. In spreading tissues, the wave travels
backwards from the leading edge, directing cell migration toward
free space. Panels (b)-(c) are from ref.18

lar to longitudinal sound waves, tissue waves stretch and compress cells as they travel. Most strikingly, the waves are selfsustained; they travel long distances (∼ 1 mm) unattenuated.
This observation is surprising because cell motion is so slow
that inertia is negligible. Therefore, these waves cannot be
sustained by the common back-and-forth between kinetic and
potential energy familiar from the harmonic oscillator. Moreover, there are many sources of dissipation in tissues, including cell-cell and cell-substrate friction, which could potentially damp the waves. Thus, the very existence of mechanical waves in tissues implies an active driving mechanism that
compensates damping and generates an effective inertia.
The quest to understand these waves led to a plethora of
physical models, ultimately revealing a palette of possible
mechanisms1
. Recently, the situation has been clarified by experiments revealing that mechanical waves are accompanied
by waves of ERK, an extracellular signaling molecule that affects cellular activity (Fig. 5a). Following these observations,
researchers developed a theory based on the feedback between
the biochemical regulator and cell mechanics (Fig. 5b), which
produces coupled chemical and mechanical waves. Assuming that cells polarize in response to stress gradients in the
monolayer, the theory also explains propagation away from
the leading edge in spreading tissues18 (Fig. 5c).
These results show that cells can exploit mechanochemical
feedbacks to transmit local information over long distances.
This tissue-scale communication is relevant for wound healing, enabling distant cells to coordinate their migration toward
the wound. Similar principles operate in morphogenesis, enabling coordinated cell deformations to precisely shape tissues without requiring local genetic control of cellular forces.
From a physics perspective, this research highlights that the
cells’ ability to generate, sense, and respond to signals, both
chemical and mechanical, can give rise to emergent phenomena as counter-intuitive as mechanical waves without inertia.
Outlook
The physics of active living matter is increasingly successful at explaining the dynamics of collective cell migration.
This core biological process is being understood through concepts such as orientational order, flow, turbulence, jamming,
wetting and wave propagation. The mechanistic origin and
physical properties of these phenomena in cells, however, differ fundamentally from those in non-living matter. Whereas
new active matter theories progressively manage to explain
the broad phenomenology of collective cell migration in terms
of a small number of physical variables, how cells tune these
variables through thousands of genes
