Abstract
A novel token-distance-based triple approach is proposed for identifying EPU mentions
in textual documents. The method is applied to a corpus of French-language news to
construct a century-long historical EPU index for the Canadian province of Quebec. The
relevance of the index is shown in a macroeconomic nowcasting experiment.

1. Introduction
The Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index developed by Baker et al. (2016) is an
important indicator in economic and financial applications (see, e.g., Caldara et al., 2019;
Aliaga-D´ıaz et al., 2019; Brogaard and Detzel, 2012; Chen et al., 2016; Sum, 2012). Following the seminal American EPU index, several country/region-specific indices have been
developed (see, e.g., Algaba et al., 2020; Ghirelli et al., 2019; Donadelli et al., 2020), including a Canadian index that uses articles from five English-language Canadian newspapers
and starts in 1985. This note uses a unique French Canadian news corpus to construct

more than a century of Canadian EPU from the province of Quebec’s perspective. Quebec is a key player in the Canadian economy; it has more than 20% of the Canadian
population and is the second contributor to Canadian GDP after Ontario. About 80% of
Quebec residents use French as their main language.
Our data set and the historical aspect of our index raise some challenges. First, the
archives of several news sources are grouped by issue rather than by individual articles,
which renders the standard EPU count impossible. Second, the availability of archives
for particular media sources differs over time, making the static-window standardization
used in the traditional sources’ aggregation biased.
We propose a novel token-distance-based triple approach to identify EPU mentions in
textual documents and use a dynamic normalization for the sources’ aggregation to address
these problems. We believe our methodology will help researchers compute EPU-like
measures from a wider range of textual sources (both in terms of variety and availability)
in future studies. We show that our EPU index spikes at major regional and worldwide
events. Finally, we show that our index outperforms the existing Canadian EPU when
nowcasting major Canadian and Quebec macroeconomic variables.
2. Data and methodology
2.1. Data
We consider four sources of French-language news available in Quebec. Archives for
three newspapers are retrieved from the Biblioth`eque et Archives Nationales du Qu´ebec
(BAnQ): (i) La Presse (January 1928 - December 2013), (ii) Le Devoir (January 1910 -
December 2011) and (iii) Le Soleil (January 1972 - December 2006). The original daily
issues for these three sources are converted into a computer-readable format using optical
character recognition (OCR) technology. The fourth source consists of French-language
news articles from Radio-Canada (the francophone arm of the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation) from January 2003 to June 2020. We process the raw data set the standard
way. We transform our textual documents (issues and articles) into vectors of tokens
using the Word Boundary Rules defined in the Unicode© Standard.12
2.2. Index construction methodology
Our index construction deviates from Baker et al. (2016) in three aspects: (i) dictionary,
(iii) EPU count and (iii) source aggregation.
1Tokens are the individual units of texts; see http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Word_
Boundaries. We remove any tokens that are French stop words (e.g., “le”), punctuation, and that
contain numeric or non-alphanumeric characters.
2To illustrate our text processing, the sentence “Le salaire minimum passera `a 13,50$ l’heure samedi.”,
is represented by the five-token vector [salaire, minimum, passera, heure, samedi] at the end of the process.
More details is available in the Internet appendix.

Dictionary. As we are examining French documents, we rely on a list of French EPU
keywords instead of the original list of English keywords. We use the dictionary provided
by Algaba et al. (2020), which is based on a translation-enhanced word2vec approach,
and add a few tax-related words specific to Canada or Quebec.3
EPU count. For three of our sources, news is aggregated by issue. It is impossible to
identify individual articles in an automated way, so we cannot perform the standard
article-based EPU count. Instead, we try to identify EPU mentions by measuring the
distance between tokens in EPU triples contained in each document. First, we determine
the token positions of all EPU keywords occurring in the text. From these identified
keywords, we construct all possible EPU triples for which we measure the maximum
relative distance between the token-triple positions (i.e., the maximum of the absolute
difference between the token position of the E-P, E-U and P-U keywords).4 We only
keep triples with a maximum distance less than or equal to a given threshold τ . The
threshold aims to avoid mixing EPU triples between unrelated articles within an issue
(i.e., it controls for false positives).5 From this subset, to avoid multiple counting, we
count the number of unique triples: Trid,t,s denotes the count in document d published
in month t by source s.
6 Then, following Baker et al. (2016), we aggregate and scale our
counts by source each month to get a monthly source-specific frequency-count measure:
Ft,s =
PDt,s
d=1 Trid,t,s
PDt,s
d=1 Tokd,t,s
, (1)
where Tokd,t,s denotes the total number of tokens for document d published in month t
by source s, and Dt,s denotes the total number of documents published in month t by
source s.
Source aggregation. In Baker et al. (2016), the source-specific frequency-count variables
Ft,s are first standardized by their standard deviation computed over a fixed and common
time period. They are then aggregated to build the EPU index.7 The standardization aims
to account for differences in the variability of sources’ reporting. However, the availability
3We also test several enhancements of the dictionary using Latent Dirichlet Allocation on the news
selected at EPU spikes over various periods. Results with alternative lexicons are qualitatively similar.
4
If a keyword comprises more than one token, leading to multiple token positions for the keyword and
thus multiple possible distances for a given triple, the minimum distance is taken.
5We use τ = 125 tokens, the median number of tokens in Radio-Canada articles. For Radio-Canada,
we set τ = ∞ as this source is available at the article level. We also test alternative setups, and find that
results are similar for values ranging from τ = 50 to τ = 1, 000. Lower values are too restrictive, and
larger values result in triples being observed in unrelated news articles, leading to a noisier index.
6A unique triple is defined as a set of three unique token positions. For instance, consider two triples
with positions {1, 4, 8} and {1, 7, 10}. They count as a unique triple since position 1 appears in both.
In other words, a token position can only be used once.
7The fixed-time window ranges from 1985 to 2009 for the American EPU, while the Canadian EPU
relies on data before 2011.
3
of our sources differs across time periods. Hence, the variability but also the level of Ft,s
are period-specific, making the traditional aggregation biased.8 To tackle this, we propose
a dynamic approach. In month t, we first scale Ft,s by its m-past months (rolling-window)
standard deviation to ensure similar variation across sources. Second, we divide the scaled
variable by its m-past months average to ensure similar levels across sources.9 Then, we
aggregate the source-specific scaled and normalized frequency-count measures, EPUt,s, to
construct the EPU index in month t:
EPUt =
X
St
s=1
EPUt,s
St
, (2)
where St denotes available sources in month t.
Our EPU construction ensures the index in month t is only based on data available
up to month t (i.e., it is not forward-looking biased), which can be critical for practical
applications such as forecasting. Note that the length of the rolling-window m makes
the interpretation of the EPU relative to its past m-month values.10 We believe it is a
reasonable approach compared to selecting a single fixed reference period, especially for
such a long time frame. The dynamic normalization accounts for a possible evolution in
the media’s writing style and type of news coverage.11
3. Validation of the index
In Figure 1, we display the evolution of our EPU index (January 1913 to June 2020)
together with the historical American EPU (January 1900 to October 2014) and the
Canadian EPU (January 1985 to June 2020).12 We see that our index spikes at major
economic events. When looking over our 100-year time horizon, three peaks are particularly large: (i) the Great Depression, (ii) the 2008 financial crisis, and (iii) the COVID-19
pandemic. Moreover, the index tends to be higher post-war and during some other events
such as the patriation of the Canadian constitution in 1982 (a national event) or the Oka
crisis in 1990 (a Quebec-specific event). In comparison, the American index does not spike
during the Great Depression or the post-war recession, raising questions about its accu8For instance, consider two sources whose EPU count frequency levels are different (one high and one
low). If the low-count source disappears from the sample, the aggregate EPU will increase, despite the
absence of an EPU event. We refer to the Internet appendix for illustrations.
9We set m = 36 months (i.e., three-year rolling windows). An alternative setup with m = 60 leads to
similar graphical results with a correlation of 0.94, and nonsignificant different nowcasting performance;
see the Internet appendix.
10We set m = 36 months in our empirical applications. Results with m = 60 are qualitatively similar
and are available in the Internet appendix.
11In the Internet appendix, we show that the dynamic approach better identifies historical events/crises
and provides better nowcasting performance than a fixed-window approach as in Baker et al. (2016).

racy.
13 The Canadian EPU seems to track the Quebec EPU until 2010, when we start to
see a large discrepancy whereby the Canadian EPU increases with no economic rationale.
This discrepancy could be attributed to differences in calculation methodologies and/or
data sources used to build the indices. A change in the media landscape could also explain
this upward trend in the Canadian EPU, justifying the need for a dynamic normalization
approach.

4. Nowcasting macroeconomic variables
We now investigate our EPU index’s effectiveness in nowcasting five monthly macroeconomic variables: (i) log-changes in Canadian gross domestic product (GDP), (ii) logchanges in Canadian and Quebec consumer price indices (CPIs), and (iii) changes in
Canadian and Quebec unemployment rates (UNEMPs).14 We use the following specification:
M0
: yt|t+1 = β0 + β1yt−1|t + β2EPUt|t + θ
0
xt−1|t + t
, (3)
where yt|• is the macroeconomic variable of interest, xt−1|• is a vector of lagged explanatory variables, and t
is an error term. We consider a large set of Canadian and Quebec
macroeconomic variables in xt−1|•; see Fortin-Gagnon et al. (2018).15 With our conditioning notation, we emphasize that all variables but the EPU are available with a time
lag. We aim to evaluate out-of-sample nowcasting performance estimating the model on
60-month rolling windows starting in January 1985 and ending in June 2020.16 This,
however, results in a smaller sample size than the number of coefficients needed to be
estimated, making the ordinary least squares framework unfeasible.
To deal with the high dimension, we proceed in two ways (see Ardia et al., 2019).
First, we estimate the model with an elastic-net (Zou and Hastie, 2005). Elastic-net is a
penalized linear regression model that performs variable selection and shrinks regression
coefficients towards zero, making the estimation of a model where the number of coefficients is larger than the number of observations feasible. The extent of the penalization
is driven by hyper-parameters, which we select using the BIC-like criterion of Zou et al.
(2007). Second, we reduce the dimensionality of the explanatory variables using principal
components. This transformation into a lower-dimensional space then allows estimating the model using ordinary least squares. We select the number of optimal principal
components following Bai and Ng (2002).
13According to https://www.policyuncertainty.com, the American historical index is still a work in
progress.
14Quebec GDP is not available at the monthly frequency.
15The full dataset is available at https://www.stevanovic.uqam.ca/DS_LCMD.html. In our nowcasting exercise, the number of available variables ranges from 130 to 140.
16We choose this time window to compare our EPU with the Canadian EPU.

Performance results are reported in Table 1 with our baseline model M0
together with
a model M1 without EPU (i.e., β2 = 0) and a model M2
for which the EPU is the Canadian EPU. First, for both the elastic-net and the principal components approaches, we
find that our EPU-enhanced model has better results than the model using only macroeconomic variables (M0 vs. M1
). This holds for the root-mean-square forecast error
(RMSFE) and the mean absolute forecast error (MAFE) performance metrics. The improvement is statistically significant at the 5% level for Canadian GDP and for Canadian
and Quebec unemployment. Hence, our Quebec EPU helps to nowcast macroeconomic
variables at the provincial and national levels. Next, we find that our EPU outperforms
the nowcasting ability of the traditional Canadian EPU (M0 vs. M2
). For both the
estimation methods or the performance metrics, the outperformance is significant at the
5% level for Canadian GDP and unemployment rates for Quebec and Canada.17

Table 1: Nowcasting results
The table reports the root-mean-square forecast error (RMSFE) and the mean absolute forecast error (MAFE) for the various models applied to five monthly macroeconomic variables:
Canadian gross domestic product (GDP, log-changes), consumer price index (CPI, log-changes),
and unemployment rate (UNEMP, changes); and Quebec CPI and UNEMP. We consider M0
in (3) and two alternatives: M1
is without EPU (i.e., β = 0) and M2
is with the Canadian
EPU instead of our EPU. Squared parentheses report the p-value of a Diebold-Marino test of
outperformance of M0 against M• using the approach described in Ardia et al. (2019). The
out-of-sample performance window ranges from January 1990 to June 2020 for a total of 366
observations (the first rolling window used to estimate the models ranges from January 1985 to
December 1989).
