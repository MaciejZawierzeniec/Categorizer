Reverse Mathematics (RM hereafter) is a program in the foundations of mathematics initiated by Friedman ([5, 6]) and developed extensively by Simpson and
others ([25, 26]); an introduction to RM for the ‘mathematician in the street’
may be found in [27]. We assume basic familiarity with RM, including Kohlenbach’s higher-order RM introduced in [10]. Recent developments in higher-order
RM, including our own, are published in [13–19].
Now, a splitting A ↔ [B+C] is a relatively rare phenomenon in second-order
RM where a natural theorem A can be split into two independent natural parts B
and C. Splittings are quite common in higher-order RM, as studied in some detail
in [23]. An unanswered question here is whether the higher-order generalisations
of the Big Five of RM (and related principles) have natural splittings.

In this paper, we study the Vitali and Heine-Borel covering theorems for
uncountable coverings with an eye on splittings. In particular, our starting point
is HBU, defined in Section 1.2, which is the Heine-Borel theorem for uncountable
coverings ∪x∈[0,1]I
Ψ
x
for arbitrary third-order Ψ : [0, 1] → R
+ and I
Ψ
x ≡ (x −
Ψ(x), x + Ψ(x)). This kind of coverings was already studied by Cousin in 1895
([3]) and Lindel¨of in 1903 ([12]). In Section 2.2, we obtain an elegant splitting
involving HBU, namely as follows:
HBU ↔ [WHBU+ + HBC0 + WKL], (1.1)
where WHBU+ is a strengthening of the Vitali covering theorem and where HBC0
is the Heine-Borel theorem for countable collections (and not sequences) of open
intervals, as formulated by Borel himself in [1]. In Section 2.1, we prove HBU ↔
HBUæ, where the latter is HBU restricted to functions Ψ : [0, 1] → R
+ continuous
almost everywhere on the unit interval. By contrast, the same restriction for the
Vitali covering theorem results in a theorem equivalent to weak weak K¨onig’s
lemma WWKL. The results in Section 2.1 were obtained following the study of
splittings involving ‘continuity almost everywhere’. The proof of Theorem 2.2 (in
a stronger system) was suggested to us by Dag Normann. In general, this paper
constitutes a spin-off from our joint project with Dag Normann on the Reverse
Mathematics and computability theory of the uncountable (see [13, 17, 19]).
Finally, the foundational and historical significance of our results is as follows.
Remark 1.1 First of all, as shown in [13, 15, 16], the third-order statements
HBU and WHBU cannot be proved Z
ω
2
, a conservative extension of Z2 based
on third-order comprehension functionals. A sceptic of third-order objects could
‘downplay’ this independence result by pointing to the outermost quantifier of
HBU and WHBU and declare that the strength of these principles is simply due
to the quantification over all third-order functions. This point is moot in light of
HBU ↔ HBUæ proved in Theorem 2.2, and the central role of ‘continuity almost
everywhere’ in e.g. the study of the Riemann integral and measure theory.
Secondly, our first attempt at obtaining a splitting for HBU was to decompose
the latter as HBUæ + WHBU, where WHBU allows one to reduce an arbitrary
covering to a covering generated by a function that is continuous almost everywhere. Alas, this kind of splitting does not yield independent conjuncts, which
is why we resort to stronger notions like countability, namely in Section 2.2.
Thirdly, the splitting in (1.1) has some historical interest as well: Borel himself formulates the Heine-Borel theorem in [1] using countable collections of intervals rather than sequences of intervals (as in second-order RM). In fact, Borel’s
proof of the Heine-Borel theorem in [1, p. 42] starts with: Let us enumerate our
intervals, one after the other, according to whatever law, but determined. He then
proceeds with the usual ‘interval-halving’ proof, similar to Cousin in [3].
1.2 Preliminaries
We introduce some axioms and definitions from (higher-order) RM needed below.
We refer to [10, §2] or [13, §2] for the definition of Kohlebach’s base theory RCAω
0
,
Splittings and robustness for the Heine-Borel theorem 3
and basic definitions like the real numbers R in RCAω
0
. For completeness, some
definitions are included in the technical appendix, namely Section A.
Some axioms of higher-order arithmetic First of all, the functional ϕ in
(∃
2
) is clearly discontinuous at f = 11 . . . ; in fact, (∃
2
) is equivalent to the
existence of F : R → R such that F(x) = 1 if x >R 0, and 0 otherwise ([10, §3]).
(∃ϕ
2 ≤2 1)(∀f
1
)

(∃n)(f(n) = 0) ↔ ϕ(f) = 0
. (∃
2
)
Related to (∃
2
), the functional µ
2
in (µ
2
) is also called Feferman’s µ ([10]).
(∃µ
2
)(∀f
1
)

(∃n)(f(n) = 0) → [f(µ(f)) = 0 ∧ (∀i < µ(f))(f(i) 6= 0)] (µ
2
)
∧ [(∀n)(f(n) 6= 0) → µ(f) = 0]
.
Intuitively, µ
2
is the least-number-operator, i.e. µ(f) provides the least n ∈ N
such that f(n) = 0, if such there is. We have (∃
2
) ↔ (µ
2
) over RCAω
0
and ACAω
0 ≡
RCAω
0 +(∃
2
) proves the same second-order sentences as ACA0 by [9, Theorem 2.5].
Secondly, the Heine-Borel theorem states the existence of a finite sub-covering
for an open covering of certain spaces. Now, a functional Ψ : R → R
+ gives rise
to the canonical cover ∪x∈I I
Ψ
x
for I ≡ [0, 1], where I
Ψ
x
is the open interval
(x − Ψ(x), x + Ψ(x)). Hence, the uncountable covering ∪x∈I I
Ψ
x has a finite subcovering by the Heine-Borel theorem; in symbols:
Principle 1.2 (HBU) (∀Ψ : R → R
+)(∃y0, . . . , yk ∈ I)(∀x ∈ I)(x ∈ ∪i≤kI
Ψ
yi
).
Cousin and Lindel¨of formulate their covering theorems using canonical covers in
[3, 12]. This restriction does not make much of a difference, as studied in [24].
Thirdly, let WHBU be the following weakening of HBU:
Principle 1.3 (WHBU) For any Ψ : R → R
+ and ε >R 0, there are pairwise
distinct y0, . . . , yk ∈ I with 1 − ε <R
P
i≤k
|J
Ψ
yi
|, where J
Ψ
yi+1
:= I
Ψ
yi+1
\ (∪j≤iI
Ψ
yi
).
As discussed at length in [14], WHBU expresses the essence of the Vitali covering
theorem for uncountable coverings; Vitali already considered the latter in [31].
Basic properties of the gauge integral ([28]) are equivalent to HBU while WHBU
is equivalent to basic properties of the Lebesgue integral (without RM-codes;
[14]). By [13, 14, 16], Z
Ω
2 proves HBU and WHBU, but Z
ω
2
cannot. The exact
definition of Z
ω
2 and Z
Ω
2
is in the aforementioned references and Section A.2.
What is relevant here is that Z
ω
2 and Z
Ω
2 are conservative extensions of Z2 by
[9, Cor. 2.6], i.e. the former prove the same second-order sentences as the latter.
We note that HBU (resp. WHBU) is the higher-order counterpart of WKL
(resp. WWKL), i.e. weak K¨onig’s lemma (resp. weak weak K¨onig’s lemma) from
RM as the ECF-translation ([10, 29]) maps HBU (resp. WHBU) to WKL (resp.
WWKL), i.e. these are (intuitively) weak principles. We refer to [10, §2] or Remark A.1 for a discussion of the relation between ECF and RCAω
0
.
Finally, the aforementioned results suggest that (higher-order) comprehension as in Z
ω
2
is not the right way of measuring the strength of HBU. As a better
alternative, we have introduced the following axiom in [22].
4 S. Sanders
Principle 1.4 (BOOT) (∀Y
2
)(∃X ⊂ N)(∀n
0
)

n ∈ X ↔ (∃f
1
)(Y (f, n) = 0)
.
By [22, §3], BOOT is equivalent to convergence theorems for nets, we have the
implication BOOT → HBU, and RCAω
0 +BOOT has the same first-order strength
as ACA0. Moreover, BOOT is a natural fragment of Feferman’s projection axiom
(Proj1) from [4]. Thus, BOOT is a natural axiom that provides a better ‘scale’
for measuring the strength of HBU and its ilk, as discussed in [17, 22].
Some basic definitions We introduce the higher-order definitions of ‘open’
and ‘countable’ set, as can be found in e.g. [15, 17, 19].
First of all, open sets are represented in second-order RM as countable unions
of basic open sets ([26, II.5.6]), and we refer to such sets as ‘RM-open’. By
[26, II.7.1], one can effectively convert between RM-open sets and (RM-codes for)
continuous characteristic functions. Thus, a natural extension of the notion of
‘open set’ is to allow arbitrary (possibly discontinuous) characteristic functions,
as is done in e.g. [15, 17, 21], which motivates the following definition.
Definition 1.5 [Sets in RCAω
0
] We let Y : R → R represent subsets of R as
follows: we write ‘x ∈ Y ’ for ‘Y (x) >R 0’ and call a set Y ⊆ R ‘open’ if for every
x ∈ Y , there is an open ball B(x, r) ⊂ Y with r
0 > 0. A set Y is called ‘closed’
if the complement, denoted Y
c = {x ∈ R : x 6∈ Y }, is open.
For open Y as in Definition 1.5, the formula ‘x ∈ Y ’ has the same complexity
(modulo higher types) as for RM-open sets, while given (∃
2
) it is equivalent to
a ‘proper’ characteristic function, only taking values ‘0’ and ‘1’. Hereafter, an
‘(open) set’ refers to Definition 1.5; ‘RM-open set’ refers to the definition from
second-order RM, as in e.g. [26, II.5.6].
Secondly, the definition of ‘countable set’ (Kunen; [11]) is as follows in RCAω
0
.
Definition 1.6 [Countable subset of R] A set A ⊆ R is countable if there exists
Y : R → N such that (∀x, y ∈ A)(Y (x) =0 Y (y) → x =R y). If Y : R → N is also
surjective, i.e. (∀n ∈ N)(∃x ∈ A)(Y (x) = n), we call A strongly countable.
Hereafter, ‘(strongly) countable’ refers to Definition1.6, unless stated otherwise.
We note that ‘countable’ is defined in second-order RM using sequences ([26,
V.4.2]), a notion we shall call ‘enumerable’.
Thirdly, we have explored the connection between HBU, generalisations of
HBU, and fragments of the neighbourhood function principle NFP from [30] in
[22, 24]. In each case, nice equivalences were obtained assuming A0 as follows.
Principle 1.7 (A0) For Y
2 and A(σ) ≡ (∃g ∈ 2
N)(Y (g, σ) = 0), we have
(∀f ∈ N
N)(∃n ∈ N)A(fn) → (∃G
2
)(∀f ∈ N
N)A(fG(f)),
where fn is the finite sequence hf(0), f(1), . . . , f(n − 1)i.
As discussed in [22, 24], the axiom A0 is a fragment of NFP and can be viewed
as a generalisation of QF-AC1,0
, included in RCAω
0
. As an alternative to A0, one
could add ‘extra data’ or moduli to the theorems to be studied.
Splittings and robustness for the Heine-Borel theorem 5
2 Main results
In Section 2.1, we show that HBU is equivalent to HBUæ, i.e. the restriction to
functions continuous almost everywhere , while the same restriction applied to
WHBU results in a theorem equivalent to WWKL (see [26, X.1] for the latter).
In Section 2.2, we establish the splitting (1.1) involving HBU.
2.1 Ontological parsimony and the Heine-Borel theorem
We introduce HBUæ, the restriction of HBU from Section 1.2 to functions continuous almost everywhere, and establish HBU ↔ HBUæ over RCAω
0
. The same
restriction for WHBU turns out to be equivalent to weak weak K¨onig’s lemma
(WWKL; see [26, X.1]), well-known from second-order RM.
We first need the following definition, where we note that the usual1 definition
of ‘measure zero’ is used in RM.
Definition 2.1 [Continuity almost everywhere] We say that Ψ : [0, 1] → R is
continuous almost everywhere if it is continuous outside of an RM-closed set
E ⊂ [0, 1] which has measure zero.
Let HBUæ be HBU restricted to functions continuous almost everywhere as in
the previous definition. The proof of the following theorem (in a stronger system)
was suggested by Dag Normann, for which we are grateful.
Theorem 2.2 The system RCAω
0 proves HBU ↔ HBUæ.
Proof. First of all, as noted in Section 1.2, (∃
2
) is equivalent to the existence of a
discontinuous R → R-function, namely by [10, Prop. 3.12]. Thus, in case ¬(∃
2
),
all functions on R are continuous. In this case, we trivially obtain HBU ↔ HBUæ.
Since RCAω
0
is a classical system, we have the law of excluded middle as in
¬(∃
2
) ∨ (∃
2
). As we have provided a proof in the first case ¬(∃
2
), it suffices to
provide a proof assuming (∃
2
), and the law of excluded middle finishes the proof.
Hence, for the rest of the proof, we may assume (∃
2
).
Secondly, the Cantor middle third set C ⊂ [0, 1] is available in RCA0 by (the
proof of) [26, IV.1.2] as an RM-closed set, as well as the well-known recursive
homeomorphism from Cantor space 2N to C defined as H : 2N → [0, 1] and
H(f) := P∞
n=0
2f(n)
3n+1 . Note that given ∃
2
, we can decide whether x ∈ C or not.
Thirdly, we prove HBUæ → HBUc, where the latter is HBU for 2N as follows:
(∀G
2
)(∃f0, . . . , fk ∈ 2
N)(∀g ∈ 2
N)(∃i ≤ k)(g ∈ [fiG(fi)]) (HBUc)
and where [σ] is the open neighbourhood in 2N of sequences starting with the
finite binary sequence σ. The equivalence HBU ↔ HBUc may be found in [13,16].
1 A set A ⊂ R is measure zero if for any ε > 0 there is a sequence of basic open
intervals (In)n∈N such that ∪n∈NIn covers A and has total length below ε.
6 S. Sanders
Now assume HBCæ and fix G2 and define Ψ : [0, 1] → R
+ using (∃
2
) as:
Ψ(x) := (
d(x, C) x 6∈ C
1
2G(I(x)) otherwise
, (2.1)
where I(x) is the unique f ∈ 2
N such that H(f) = x in case x ∈ C, and
00 . . . otherwise. Note that the distance function d(x, C) exists given ACA0 by
[7, Theorem 1.2]. Clearly, ∃
2 allows us to define this function as a third-order
object that is continuous on [0, 1] \ C. Since C has measure zero (and is RMclosed), apply HBUæ to ∪x∈[0,1]I
Ψ
x
. Let y0, . . . , yk be such that ∪i≤kI
Ψ
yi
covers
[0, 1]. By the definition of Ψ in (2.1), if x ∈ [0, 1] \ C, then C ∩ I
Ψ
x = ∅. Hence,
let z0, . . . , zm be those yi ∈ C for i ≤ k and note that ∪j≤mI
Ψ
zj
covers C. Clearly,
I(z0), . . . , I(zm) yields a finite sub-cover of ∪f∈2N [fG(f)], and HBUc follows. ⊓⊔
We could of course formulate HBUæ with the higher-order notion of ‘closed set’
from [15], and the equivalence from the theorem would still go through. The
proof of the theorem also immediately yields the following.
Corollary 2.3 (ACAω
0
) HBU is equivalent to the Heine-Borel theorem for canonical coverings ∪x∈EI
Ψ
x
, where E ⊂ [0, 1] is RM-closed and has measure zero.
As expected, Theorem 2.2 generalises to principles that imply HBU over RCAω
0
(see [17, Figure 1] for an overview) and that boast a third-order functional to
which the ‘continuous almost everywhere’ restriction can be naturally applied.
An example is the following corollary involving BOOT.
Corollary 2.4 The system RCAω
0 proves BOOT ↔ BOOTæ, where the latter is
(∃X ⊂ N)(∀n
0
)

n ∈ X ↔ (∃x ∈ [0, 1])(Y (x, n) = 0)
,
where λx.Y (x, n) is continuous almost everywhere on [0, 1] for any fixed n ∈ N.
Proof. In case ¬(∃
2
), all functions on R are continuous by [10, Prop. 3.12]; in this
case, the equivalence is trivial. In case (∃
2
), the forward direction is immediate,
modulo coding real numbers given ∃
2
. For the reverse direction, fix Y
2 and
note that we may restrict the quantifier (∃f
1
) in BOOT to 2N without loss of
generality. Indeed, µ
2 allows us to represent f
1 via its graph, a subset of N
2
,
which can be coded as a binary sequence. Now define
Z(x, n) := (
0 x ∈ C ∧ Y (I(x), n) = 0
1 otherwise
, (2.2)
where C and I are as in the theorem. Note that λx.Z(x, n) is continuous outside
of C. By BOOTæ, there is X ⊂ N such that for all n ∈ N, we have:
n ∈ X ↔ (∃x ∈ [0, 1])(Z(x, n) = 0) ↔ (∃f ∈ 2
N)(Y (f, n) = 0),
where the last equivalence is by the definition of Z in (2.2). ⊓⊔
Splittings and robustness for the Heine-Borel theorem 7
Next, we show that the Vitali covering theorem as in WHBU behaves quite
differently from the Heine-Borel theorem as in HBU. Recall that the Heine-Borel
theorem applies to open coverings of compact sets, while the Vitali covering
theorem applies to Vitali coverings2 of any set E of finite (Lebesgue) measure.
The former provides a finite sub-covering while the latter provides a sequence
that covers E up to a set of measure zero. As argued in [14], WHBU is the
combinatorial essence of Vitali’s covering theorem.
Now, let WHBUæ be WHBU restricted to functions continuous almost everywhere, as in Definition 2.1; recall that Z
ω
2
cannot prove WHBU.
Theorem 2.5 The system RCAω
0 + WKL proves WHBUæ.
Proof. Let Ψ : [0, 1] → R
+ be continuous on [0, 1] \ E with E ⊂ [0, 1] of measure
zero and RM-closed. Fix ε > 0 and let ∪n∈NIn be a union of basic open intervals
covering E and with measure at most ε/2. Then [0, 1] is covered by:
∪q∈Q\E B(q, Ψ(q))[
∪n∈NIn. (2.3)
Indeed, that the covering in (2.3) covers E is trivial, while [0, 1]\E is (RM)-open.
Hence, x0 ∈ [0, 1]\E implies that B(x0, r) ⊂ [0, 1]\E for r > 0 small enough and
for q ∈ Q∩[0, 1] close enough to x0, we have x0 ∈ B(q, Ψ(q)). By [26, IV.1], WKL
is equivalent to the countable Heine-Borel theorem. Hence, there are q0, . . . , qk ∈
Q \ E and n0 ∈ N such that the finite union ∪
k
i=1B(qi
, Ψ(qi)) S
∪
n0
j=0Ij covers
[0, 1]. Since the measure of ∪
n0
j=0Ij is at most ε/2, the measure of ∪
k
i=1B(qi
, Ψ(qi))
is at least 1 − ε/2, as required by WHBUæ. ⊓⊔
Corollary 2.6 The system RCAω
0 proves WWKL ↔ WHBUæ.
Proof. The reverse implication is immediate in light of the RM of WWKL in
[26, X.1], which involves the Vitali covering theorem for countable coverings
(given by a sequence). For the forward implication, convert the cover from (2.3)
to a Vitali cover and use [26, X.1.13]. ⊓⊔
Finally, recall Remark 1.1 discussing the foundational significance of the above.
2.2 Splittings for the Heine-Borel theorem
We establish a splitting for HBU as in Theorem 2.9 based on known principles
formulated with countable sets as in Definition 1.6. As will become clear, there
is also some historical interest in this study.
First of all, the following principle HBC0 is studied in [17, §3], while the (historical and foundational) significance of this principle is discussed in Remark 1.1.
The aforementioned system Z
ω
2
cannot prove HBC0.
2 An open covering V is a Vitali covering of E if any point of E can be covered by
some open in V with arbitrary small (Lebesgue) measure.
8 S. Sanders
Principle 2.7 (HBC0) For countable A ⊂ R
2 with (∀x ∈ [0, 1])(∃(a, b) ∈ A)(x ∈
(a, b)), there are (a0, b0), . . . ,(ak, bk) ∈ A with (∀x ∈ [0, 1])(∃i ≤ k)(x ∈ (ai
, bi)).
Secondly, the second-order Vitali covering theorem has a number of equivalent formulations (see [26, X.1]), including the statement a countable covering
of [0, 1] has a sub-collection with measure zero complement. Intuitively speaking, the following principle WHBU+ strengthens ‘measure zero’ to ‘countable’.
Alternatively, WHBU+ can be viewed as a weakening of the Lindel¨of lemma,
introduced in [12] and studied in higher-order RM in [13, 16].
Principle 2.8 (WHBU+) For Ψ : [0, 1] → R
+, there is a sequence (yn)n∈N in
[0, 1] such that [0, 1] \ ∪n∈NI
Ψ
yn
is countable.
Note that WHBU+ + HBC0 yields a conservative3
extension of RCAω
0
, i.e. the
former cannot imply HBU without the presence of WKL. Other independence
results are provided by Theorem 2.10.
We have the following theorem, where A0 was introduced in Section 1.2. This
axiom can be avoided by enriching4
the antecedent of HBC0.
Theorem 2.9 The system RCAω
0 + A0 proves
[WHBU+ + HBC0 + WKL] ↔ HBU, (2.4)
where the axiom A0 is only needed for HBU → HBC0.
Proof. First of all, in case ¬(∃
2
), all functions on R are continuous, rendering
WHBU+ + HBC0 trivial while HBU reduces to WKL. Hence, for the rest of the
proof, we may assume (∃
2
), by the law of excluded middle as in (∃
2
) ∨ ¬(∃
2
).
For the reverse implication, assume A0 + HBU and let A be as in HBC0. The
functional ∃
2
can uniformly convert real numbers to a binary representation.
Hence (2.5) is equivalent to a formula as in the antecedent of A0:
(∀x ∈ [0, 1])(∃n ∈ N)

(∃(a, b) ∈ A)(a < [x](n + 1) −
1
2n ∧ [x](n + 1) + 1
2n < b)

,
(2.5)
where ‘[x](n)’ is the n-th approximation of the real x, given as a fast-converging
Cauchy sequence. Apply A0 to (2.5) to obtain G : [0, 1] → N such that G(x) = n
as in (2.5). Apply HBU to ∪x∈[0,1]I
Ψ
x
for Ψ(x) := 1
2G(x)
. The finite sub-cover
y0, . . . , yk ∈ [0, 1] provided by HBU gives rise to (ai
, bi) ∈ A containing I
Ψ
yi
for i ≤ k by the definition of G. Moreover, HBU implies WKL as the latter is
equivalent to the ‘countable’ Heine-Borel theorem as in [26, IV.1]. Clearly, the
empty set is countable by Definition 1.6 and HBU → WHBU+ is therefore trivial.
3 The system RCAω
0 + ¬(∃
2
) is an L2-conservative extension of RCAω
0 and the former
readily proves WHBU+ + HBC0. By constrast HBU → WKL over RCAω
0 .
4
In particular, one would add a function G : [0, 1] → R
2
to the antecedent of HBC0
such that G(x) ∈ A and x ∈

G(x)(1), G(x)(2)
for x ∈ [0, 1]. In this way, the
covering is given by ∪x∈[0,1](G(x)(1), G(x)(2))
Splittings and robustness for the Heine-Borel theorem 9
For the forward implication, fix Ψ : [0, 1] → R
+ and let (yn)n∈N be as in
WHBU+. Define ‘x ∈ B’ as x ∈ [0, 1] \ ∪n∈NI
Ψ
yn
and note that when B is empty,
the theorem follows as WKL implies the second-order Heine-Borel theorem ([26,
IV.1]). Now assume B 6= ∅ and define A as the set of (a, b) such that either
(a, b) = I
Ψ
x
for x ∈ B, or (a, b) = I
Ψ
yn
for some n ∈ N. Note that in the first case,
(a, b) ∈ A if and only a+b
2
∈ B, i.e. defining A does not require quantifying over
R. Moreover, A is countable because B is: if Y is injective on B, then W defined
as follows is injective on A:
W

(a, b)

:= (
2Y (
a+b
2
)
a+b
2
∈ B
H((a, b)) otherwise
,
where H((a, b)) is the least n ∈ N such that (a, b) = I
Ψ
yn
, if such there is, and
zero otherwise. The intervals in the set A cover [0, 1] as in the antecedent of
HBC0, and the latter now implies HBU. ⊓⊔
The principles WHBU+ and HBC0 are ‘quite’ independent by the following theorem, assuming the systems therein are consistent.
Theorem 2.10 The system Z
ω
2 + QF-AC0,1 + WHBU+ cannot prove HBC0.
The system RCAω
0 + HBC0 + WHBU+ cannot prove WKL0.
Proof. For the first part, suppose Z
ω
2 + QF-AC0,1 + WHBU+ does prove HBC0.
The latter implies NIN as follows by [17, Cor. 3.2]:
(∀Y : [0, 1] → N)(∃x, y ∈ [0, 1])(Y (x) = Y (y) ∧ x 6=R y). (NIN)
Clearly, ¬NIN implies WHBU+, and we obtain that Z
ω
2 +QF-AC0,1+¬NIN proves
a contradiction, namely WHBU+ and its negation. Hence, Z
ω
2 + QF-AC0,1
proves
NIN, a contradiction by [17, Theorem 3.1], and the first part follows.
For the second part, the ECF-translation (see Remark A.1) converts HBC0 +
WHBU+ into a triviality. ⊓⊔
Finally, we discuss similar results as follows. Of course, the proof of Theorem 2.9
goes through mutatis mutandis for WHBU+ + HBC0 formulated using strongly
countable sets. Moreover, (2.6) can be proved in the same way as (2.4), assuming
additional countable choice as in QF-AC0,1
:
WHBU ↔ [WHBU+ + WHBC0 + WWKL], (2.6)
where WHBC0 is HBC0 with the conclusion weakened to the existence of a sequence (an, bn)n∈N of intervals in A with measure at least one. Also, if we generalise HBU to coverings of any separably closed set in [0, 1], the resulting version
of (2.4) involves ACA0 rather than WKL0 in light of [8, Theorem 2]
