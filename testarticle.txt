Abstract. An L(2, 1)-labelling of a finite graph Γ is a function that assigns integer values to the
vertices V (Γ) of Γ (colouring of V (Γ) by Z) so that the absolute difference of two such values is
at least 2 for adjacent vertices and is at least 1 for vertices which are precisely distance 2 apart.
The lambda number λ(Γ) of Γ measures the least number of integers needed for such a labelling
(colouring). A power graph ΓG of a finite group G is a graph with vertex set as the elements of G
and two vertices are joined by an edge if and only if one of them is a positive integer power of the
other. It is known that λ(ΓG) ≥ |G| for any finite group. In this paper we show that if G is a finite
group of a prime power order, then λ(ΓG) = |G| if and only if G is neither cyclic nor a generalized
quaternion 2-group. This settles a partial classification of finite groups achieving the lower bound
of lambda number.

1. Introduction
All graphs considered in this article are assumed to be finite, undirected and simple. Let Γ be a
graph with vertex set V (Γ) and edge set E(Γ). For any a, b ∈ V (Γ), the distance d(a, b) is defined
to be the length of the shortest path joining the vertices a and b in Γ. For any j, k ∈ N0 := N∪ {0},
an L(j, k)-labelling is defined to be a function f : V (Γ) → Z that satisfies:
(i) |f(a) − f(b)| ≥ j whenever d(a, b) = 1,
(ii) |f(a) − f(b)| ≥ k whenever d(a, b) = 2.
Therefore an L(1, 0)-labelling is simply a colouring of the graph Γ by non-negative integers. For
an L(j, k)-labelling f on Γ, the span of f is defined by
span(f) := max
x∈V (Γ)
f(x) − min
x∈V (Γ)
f(x).
We also define
λj,k(Γ) := min n
span(f) : f is an L(j, k)−labelling on Γo
.
The lambda number of the graph Γ is defined by λ(Γ) := λ2,1(Γ).
The L(j, k)-labelling of graphs were motivated by the study of the radio channel assignment problem
of transmitters through radio or television channels so that the recipients are needed to be separated
by certain constraints due to interference (cf. [7, 12]). One can see [13] for a complete survey related
to the problem and the references therein.
This article is related to the study of lambda number of the power graph ΓG of a finite group G.
This graph is defined by taking the elements of G as its vertex set, and two distinct vertices a, b ∈ G
are connected by an edge if and only if either a = b
n or b = a
m for some m, n ∈ N. The notion of
(directed) power graphs were introduced in [5] while studying semigroups. Later on it was shown
in a sequel of articles [4, 3] that the power graphs of two finite groups are isomorphic if and only if

they contain the same number of elements of any given order. In this article we will be focussing
on finite groups, and consequently ΓG is always undirected.
In [10] it is shown that λ(ΓG) ≥ |G| for any finite group G and the following question is asked:
Question. Classify all finite groups G which satisfy λ(ΓG) = |G|.
Let p ∈ N be a prime. A finite group G is called a p-group if |G| = p
n
for some n ∈ N. For such a
group G, its exponent is the maximum of the orders of elements of G. The complete classification
of these groups are not known till date. The main problem is the set of parameters those describe
the presentations (or even from the viewpoint of representations given over a number field) gets
too complicated very quickly as n = logp
|G| become large.
The main theorem of this paper is:
Main Theorem. Let G be a finite p-group. Then λ(ΓG) = |G| if and only if G is neither cyclic,
nor a generalized quaternion 2-group.
Consequently, for a finite p-group G of exponent p
e we have
λ(ΓG) =



2(p
e − 1) if G is cyclic
|G| + 1 if p = 2, G is generalized quaternion
|G| otherwise
We discussed some basic group theoretic preliminaries in Section 2. The proof of the main theorem
is given in section 3.
2. Preliminaries
2.1. Definition. Let G be a finite group and n be a positive integer so that G contains an element
of order n. We define the set Λ(n; G) (or simply by Λ(n)) as
Λ(n; G) := n
g ∈ G : |g| = n
o
.
where |g| denote the order of g.
Given any two elements g1, g2 ∈ G, we define g1 ∼ g2 if the cyclic subgroups of G generated by g1
and g2 coincide. This is an equivalence relation on G. An equivalence class containing g ∈ G is
denoted by [g], and we call it a cyclic class of G. Then we have
Λ(n; G) = [
|g|=n
[g]
where the union runs over a set of class representatives g ∈ G with |g| = n. In particular, if n is a
power of a prime, then the elements of the class [g] induce a complete subgraph of the power graph
ΓG.
The class {1G} is called the trivial cyclic class, where 1G denote the identity element of the group
G. For any non-trivial cyclic class [g] with |g| = n, the class [g] contain φ(n) number of elements,
where φ denotes the Euler’s phi function. For any n ∈ N, we define the n-th cyclic class number
m(n) as the number of cyclic classes that contain the elements of order n, i.e.,
m(n) := |Λ(n; G)|
φ(n)
.
2
2.2. Note. The n-th cyclic class number m(n) of a group G is equal to the number of cyclic
subgroups of G of order n. For example, if G is a cyclic group, then m(n) = 1 for every n divides
|G|.
Let G be a group and H, K ≤ G be subgroups. The subgroup [H, K] ≤ G is defined as the subgroup
generated by all elements of the form [h, k] := h
−1k
−1hk (h ∈ H, k ∈ K). The lower central series
of subgroups of G is the descending sequence
G ≥ γ2(G) ≥ γ3(G) ≥ . . . ≥ γi(G) ≥ γi+1(G) ≥ . . .
of normal subgroups of G given by γ2(G) := [G, G] and γi+1(G) := [γi(G), G] for every i ≥ 2. If G
is a finite p-group, then this descending sequence contains only finitely many non-trivial terms (in
general such groups are called nilpotent).
A finite p-group of order p
n
is said to be of maximal class if γn−1(G) 6= {1G} and γn(G) = {1G}.
In this case G/γ2(G) ∼= Cp × Cp and γi(G)/γi+1(G) ∼= Cp for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1.
The following result says a lot more about the class numbers of a finite p-group G. For a complete
proof see [1, Theorems 1.10, 1.17].
2.3. Theorem. [11, 9, 8, 2] Let G be a finite p-group of exponent p
e
. Assume that G is not cyclic
for an odd prime p, and for p = 2, it is neither cyclic nor of maximal class. Then:
(i) m(p) ≡ 1 + p (mod p
2
).
(ii) p | m(p
i
) for every 2 ≤ i ≤ e.
2.4. Corollary. Let G be a finite p-group of exponent p
e
. Then m(p
i
) = 1 for some 1 ≤ i ≤ e if
and only if one of the following occurs:
(i) G ∼= Cp
e and m(p
j
) = 1 for all 1 ≤ j ≤ e, or
(ii) p = 2 and G is isomorphic to one of the following 2-groups:
(a) dihedral 2-group
D2
e+1 =
D
x, y : x
2
e
= 1, y2 = 1, y−1xy = x
−1
E
, (e ≥ 2)
where m(2) = 1 + 2e and m(2j
) = 1 (2 ≤ j ≤ e).
(b) generalized quaternion 2-group
Q2
e+1 =
D
x, y : x
2
e
= 1, x2
e−1
= y
2
, y−1xy = x
−1
E
, (e ≥ 2)
where m(4) = 1 + 2e−1 and m(2j
) = 1 for all 2 ≤ j ≤ e and j 6= 2.
(c) semi-dihedral 2-group
SD2
e+1 =
D
x, y : x
2
e
= 1, y2 = 1, y−1xy = x
−1+2e−1
E
, (e ≥ 3)
where m(2) = 1 + 2e−1
, m(4) = 1 + 2e−2 and m(2j
) = 1 for all 3 ≤ j ≤ e.
Proof. From Theorem 2.3, it follows that if the hypothesis holds then G is either cyclic, or else G
is a 2-group of maximal class. From [6, Theorem 5.1], G must be isomorphic to one of the groups
given in (ii)(a)–(c).
To establish that the condition is necessary and sufficient, we only need to verify the values of
m(2j
) (1 ≤ j ≤ e) as given. Since a cyclic group has a unique subgroup of order 2j
for every
1 ≤ j ≤ e, the statement (i) follows. Notice that each group given in (ii) has a cyclic maximal
subgroup hxi of order 2e
.
3
(ii)(a) For G = D2
e+1 , every element outside the maximal cyclic subgroup hxi ≤ G has order 2.
Counting the element x
2
e−1
∈ hxi of order 2, we have m(2) = 1 + 2e
. For 2 ≤ j ≤ e, an element of
order 2j
is a generator of the cyclic subgroup hx
2
e−j
i and hence m(2i
) = 1.
(ii)(b) The group G = Q2
e+1 has a unique element of order 2, namely x
2
e−1
. Since every element
outside hxi has order 4 and φ(4) = 2, with a similar argument as above, the statement follows.
(ii)(c) For G = SD2
e+1 , every element outside hxi can be uniquely written as x
ky (0 ≤ k ≤ 2
e − 1).
From the given relations it is straightforward to verify
|x
k
y| =
(
2 if k is even
4 if k is odd
.
Counting x
2
e−1
, then we have exactly 1 + 2e−1 of elements of order 2. Similarly, counting the two
elements of order 4 from hx
2
e−2
i, we have 2 + 2e−1
elements of order 4 and these form a disjoint
union of classes of size φ(4) = 2. Now all elements of order ≥ 8 must belong to hxi. 
We now look at a result from [10] and obtain some insights that are going to make the proofs of
the next section shorter and easier to understand.
2.5. Definition. Let Γ be a graph. The complement graph Γ
c
is defined as the graph with the
same vertex set V (Γ) and two vertices a, b ∈ Γ
c are joined by an edge if and only if they are not
adjacent in Γ.
2.6. Theorem. ([10, Theorem 3.1]) Let G be finite group. Then λ(ΓG) ≥ |G|, with equality if and
only if the complement graph (ΓG \ {1G})
c
contains a Hamiltonian path.
Let G be a finite group G with λ(ΓG) = |G|. We set N := |G|−2. If (x0, x1, . . . , xN ) is a Hamiltonian
path in (ΓG \ {1G})
c
, then the function f : G → Z given by f(1G) := −2 and f(xi) := i (0 ≤ i ≤ N)
defines an L(2, 1)-labelling of ΓG that achieves the lower bound span(f) = |G|.
On the other hand, if f : G → Z is an L(2, 1)-labelling of G with span(f) = |G|, then the same
holds for a translation map f + α for any α ∈ Z. Now by definition f is an injective map and
from Pigeohole principle it follows that the image Im(f) of the function f contains precisely |G|+ 1
integers with f(1G) is either the maximum or minimum of Im(f). In case f(1G) is a maximum of
Im(f) we can define an L(2, 1)-labelling f1 by
f1(x) = (
min Im(f) − 2 if x = 1G
f(x) if x 6= 1G.
Further by applying a translation we can assume that f1(1G) = −2 and Im(f) = {−2, 0, 1, . . . , N}.
Then the ordered sequence (f
−1
1
(0), f −1
1
(1), . . . , f −1

(N)) of vertices in G \ {1G} is a Hamiltonian
path in (ΓG \ {1G})
c
.
3. Proof of the main theorem
We need some preparation before we discuss the proof of the main result.

3.1. Definition. Let G be a non-trivial finite group. Two distinct cyclic classes C1 and C2 of G
are called adjacent if there are elements g1 ∈ C1 and g2 ∈ C2 so that g1 and g2 are adjacent in the
power graph ΓG.
Clearly, if the cyclic classes C1 and C2 are adjacent, then any pair of elements x1 ∈ C1 and x2 ∈ C2
are adjacent in ΓG. Moreover if the cyclic classes C1 and C2 are adjacent and are represented by
elements of the same order, then C1 = C2.
3.2. Lemma. (Lower hook lemma) Let G be a finite p-group and U, V1 and V2 be three classes
represented by elements u, v1 and v2 respectively so that max{|v1|, |v2|} ≤ |u|. If U is adjacent to
both of V1 and V2, then V1 is adjacent to V2. In particular, if |v1| = |v2|, then V1 = V2.
Figure 1.
Proof. Since u is adjacent to v1 and |v1| ≤ |u|, we have hv1i ⊆ hui. Similarly, hv2i ⊆ hui. Without
loss of generality assume that |v1| ≤ |v2|. Since hui is a cyclic group of prime power order, it follows
that |v1| divides |v2| and consequently hv1i ⊆ hv2i ⊆ hui. Now the conclusion follows from the fact
that the elements of hui induce a complete subgraph of ΓG. 
3.3. Note. The lower hook lemma 3.2 is not true for arbitrary finite groups. The cyclic group C6 of
order 6 has four classes C1, C2, C3 and C6 represented by elements of orders 1, 2, 3 and 6 respectively.
Here C6 is adjacent to both of C2 and C3; but the classes C2 and C3 are not adjacent.
3.4. Definition. Let Γ be a graph and M := (M1,M2, . . . ,Mr) be an ordered collection of subsets
of V (Γ) of equal size N for some r ≥ 2. Assume that:
(i) each Mi
induces a complete subgraph of Γ, and
(ii) for any 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ r and any a ∈ Mi
, b ∈ Mj , the vertices a and b are not adjacent in Γ.
We order the elements of Mj as follows:
Mj =
n
wj1, wj2, . . . , wjN o
, (j = 1, . . . , r).
We define the Hamiltonian path H(M) on the set ∪
N
j=1Mj of vertices (see figure 2) as a subgraph
of Γc by:
H(M) := 
w11, w21, . . . , wr−1,1, wr1, . . . , w1N , w2N , . . . , wr−1,N , wrN 
5
Figure 2. H(M)
We denote by ∂0(H(M)) := w11 and ∂1(H(M)) := wrN , the initial and the terminal vertices of the
Hamiltonian path H(M).
3.5. Theorem. Let G be a finite p-group of exponent p
e with m(p
i
) ≥ 2 for every 1 ≤ i ≤ e. Then
λ(ΓG) = |G|.
Proof. For each 1 ≤ i ≤ e, we set mi
:= m(p
i
) and let C
(i)
1
, C
(i)
2
, . . . , C
(i)
mi denote the cyclic classes
of G containing elements of order p
i
. Now from lower hook lemma 3.2 it follows that, for any
2 ≤ i ≤ e the cyclic class C
(i)
mi
is non-adjacent to one of the cyclic classes C
(i−1)
1
, C
(i−1)
2
, . . . , C
(i−1)
mi−1
.
By relabelling if necessary, we may assume that C
(i)
mi
is non-adjacent to C
(i−1)
1
.
Now for each 1 ≤ i ≤ e, we set Mi
:= (C
(i)
1
, C
(i)
2
, . . . , C
(i)
mi
) and from the definition 3.4 we construct
the Hamiltonian path H(Mi) in (ΓG)
c on the vertex set Λ(p
i
; G). Then for every e ≥ i ≥ 2, the
vertices ∂1(H(Mi)) and ∂0(H(Mi−1)) are not adjacent in the power graph ΓG, and consequently
they are connected by an edge βi
in the complement graph (ΓG)
c
. We can now construct the
Hamiltonian path H in (ΓG \ {1G})
c defined by
H := 
H(Me), βe, H(Me−1), βe−1, H(Me−2), . . . , β2, H(M1)


Proof of the main Theorem. We will first show that for the semi-dihedral 2-group G = SD2
e+1
of exponent 2e
(e ≥ 3) we have λ(ΓG) = |G| by constructing a Hamiltonian path in (ΓG \ {1G})
c
.
We are going to use the notations as given in the presentation of G in Lemma 2.4.
The cyclic maximal subgroup hxi ≤ G has order 2e and the elements outside this subgroup are
given by x
ky (0 ≤ k ≤ 2
e − 1). As noticed earlier, the order of x
ky is 2 (resp. 4) if k is even (resp.
k is odd).
6
Figure 3.
We first consider the cyclic classes of elements of order 2 and 4 from the cyclic subgroup hxi; namely
C
(1)
1 = {x
2
e−1
} ⊆ Λ(2; G) and C
(2)
1 = {x
2
e−2
, x3·2
e−2
} ⊆ Λ(4; G). Now we consider the sequence
T1 := 
y, x2
e−1
, x2
y, x2
e−2
, x4
y, x3·2
e−2

.
Clearly this forms a path in the complement graph (ΓG)
c
. Now we fix an arbitrary labelling of the
set (G \ hxi) \ {y, x2y, x4y} as follows
M =
n
x
kiy : i = 1, 2, . . . , No
where N = 2e − 3. Notice that the number of elements in C = hxi \ {1G, x2
e−1
, x2
e−2
, x2
e−1+2e−2
} is
2
e − 4 = N − 1.
We claim that for any pair of elements a ∈ C and b ∈ M, the vertices a and b are not adjacent in
ΓG (and hence they are adjacent in the complement (ΓG)
c
). To see this, notice that a is a power
of x and has order ≥ 8, whereas b has order either 2 or 4. So if they are adjacent, then b = a
m for
some positive integer m and consequently, b ∈ hxi, a contradiction.
Now setting up an arbitrary enumeration of the elements of C = {w1, w2, . . . , wN−1} we have the
following path in (ΓG)
c
T2 =

x
k1 y, w1, xk2 y, w2, . . . , xkN−1 y, wN−1, xkN y

.
7
Now a similar argument as above shows that the elements x
k1 y and x
2
e−1+2e−2
are not adjacent
in ΓG. Hence there exists an edge β in (ΓG)
c
joining these two vertices. Consequently, the path
(T1, β, T2) is a Hamiltonian path in (ΓG \ {1G})
c
. This proves that λ(ΓG) = |G|.
Now we are ready to prove the final statement. Let G be a finite p-group of exponent p
e
. Assume
that λ(ΓG) = |G|. Since λ(ΓCpe ) = 2(p
e − 1) (since ΓCpe is a complete graph) and λ(SD2
e+1 ) =
2
e+1 + 1 (see [10, Example 3.3]), G cannot be these groups.
Conversely, suppose G is neither cyclic, nor a generalized quaternion 2-group. If m(p
i
) ≥ 2 for
every 1 ≤ i ≤ e, then from Theorem 3.5, we are done. Hence using Corollary 2.4, we have p = 2
and G is isomorphic to one of the groups D2
e+1 or SD2
e+1 . If G ∼= D2
e+1 , then from [10, Example
3.2], the statement follows. Finally if G ∼= SD2
e+1 , then we have shown above that λ(ΓG) = |G|. 
